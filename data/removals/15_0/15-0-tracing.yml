    Tracing in GitLab is an integration with Jaeger, an open-source end-to-end distributed tracing system. GitLab users could previously navigate to their Jaeger instance to gain insight into the performance of a deployed application, tracking each function or microservice that handles a given request. Tracing in GitLab was deprecated in GitLab 14.7, and removed in 15.0. To track work on a possible replacement, see the issue for [Opstrace integration with GitLab](https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/6976).

# Groups **(FREE)**

In GitLab, you use groups to manage one or more related projects at the same time.

You can use groups to manage permissions for your projects. If someone has access to
the group, they get access to all the projects in the group.

You can also view all of the issues and merge requests for the projects in the group,
and view analytics that show the group's activity.

You can use groups to communicate with all of the members of the group at once.

For larger organizations, you can also create [subgroups](subgroups/index.md).

For more information about creating and managing your groups, see [Manage groups](manage.md).

## Group visibility

Like projects, a group can be configured to limit the visibility of it to:

- Anonymous users.
- All signed-in users.
- Only explicit group members.

The restriction for [visibility levels](../admin_area/settings/visibility_and_access_controls.md#restrict-visibility-levels)
on the application setting level also applies to groups. If set to internal, the explore page is
empty for anonymous users. The group page has a visibility level icon.

Administrator users cannot create a subgroup or project with a higher visibility level than that of
the immediate parent group.

    Using environment variables `GIT_CONFIG_SYSTEM` and `GIT_CONFIG_GLOBAL` to configure Gitaly is [deprecated](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/352609).
    These variables are being replaced with standard [`config.toml` Gitaly configuration](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/administration/gitaly/reference.html).

    GitLab instances that use `GIT_CONFIG_SYSTEM` and `GIT_CONFIG_GLOBAL` to configure Gitaly should switch to configuring using
    `config.toml`.

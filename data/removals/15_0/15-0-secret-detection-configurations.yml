    To make it simpler and more reliable to [customize GitLab Secret Detection](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/application_security/secret_detection/#customizing-settings), we've removed some of the variables that you could previously set in your CI/CD configuration.

    The following variables previously allowed you to customize the options for historical scanning, but interacted poorly with the [GitLab-managed CI/CD template](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/blob/master/lib/gitlab/ci/templates/Security/Secret-Detection.gitlab-ci.yml) and are now removed:

    - `SECRET_DETECTION_COMMIT_FROM`
    - `SECRET_DETECTION_COMMIT_TO`
    - `SECRET_DETECTION_COMMITS`
    - `SECRET_DETECTION_COMMITS_FILE`

    The `SECRET_DETECTION_ENTROPY_LEVEL` previously allowed you to configure rules that only considered the entropy level of strings in your codebase, and is now removed.
    This type of entropy-only rule created an unacceptable number of incorrect results (false positives).

    You can still customize the behavior of the Secret Detection analyzer using the [available CI/CD variables](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/application_security/secret_detection/#available-cicd-variables).

    For further details, see [the deprecation issue for this change](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/352565).

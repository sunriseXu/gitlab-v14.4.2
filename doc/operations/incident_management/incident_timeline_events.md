# Timeline events

> [Introduced](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/344059) in GitLab 15.2 [with a flag](../../administration/feature_flags.md) named `incident_timeline`. Enabled by default.

FLAG:
On self-managed GitLab, by default this feature is available. To hide the feature, ask an administrator to [disable the feature flag](../../administration/feature_flags.md) named `incident_timeline`.
On GitLab.com, this feature is available.

Incident timelines are an important part of record keeping for incidents.
Timelines can show executives and external viewers what happened during an incident,
and which steps were taken for it to be resolved.

## View the timeline

Incident timeline events are listed in ascending order of the date and time.
They are grouped with dates and are listed in ascending order of the time when they occurred:

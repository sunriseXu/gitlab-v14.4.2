        Elasticsearch 6.8 support has been removed in GitLab 15.0. Elasticsearch 6.8 has reached [end of life](https://www.elastic.co/support/eol).
        If you use Elasticsearch 6.8, **you must upgrade your Elasticsearch version to 7.x** prior to upgrading to GitLab 15.0.
        You should not upgrade to Elasticsearch 8 until you have completed the GitLab 15.0 upgrade.

        View the [version requirements](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/integration/elasticsearch.html#version-requirements) for details.
# The following items are not published on the docs page, but may be used in the future.

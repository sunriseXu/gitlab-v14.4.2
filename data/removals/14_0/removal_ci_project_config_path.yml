    The `CI_PROJECT_CONFIG_PATH` [predefined project variable](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/ci/variables/predefined_variables.html)
    has been removed in favor of `CI_CONFIG_PATH`, which is functionally the same.

    If you are using `CI_PROJECT_CONFIG_PATH` in your pipeline configurations,
    please update them to use `CI_CONFIG_PATH` instead.

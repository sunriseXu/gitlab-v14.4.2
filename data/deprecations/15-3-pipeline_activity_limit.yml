    The [**Maximum number of active pipelines per project** limit](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/admin_area/settings/continuous_integration.html#set-cicd-limits) was never enabled by default and will be removed in GitLab 16.0. This limit can also be configured in the Rails console under [`ci_active_pipelines`](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/administration/instance_limits.html#number-of-pipelines-running-concurrently). Instead, use the other recommended rate limits that offer similar protection:

    - [**Pipelines rate limits**](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/admin_area/settings/rate_limit_on_pipelines_creation.html).
    - [**Total number of jobs in currently active pipelines**](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/admin_area/settings/continuous_integration.html#set-cicd-limits).

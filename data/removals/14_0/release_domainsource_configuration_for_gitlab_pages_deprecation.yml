    GitLab Pages [API-based configuration](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/administration/pages/#gitlab-api-based-configuration) has been available since GitLab 13.0. It replaces the unsupported `disk` source configuration removed in GitLab 14.0, which can no longer be chosen. You should stop using `disk` source configuration, and move to `gitlab` for an API-based configuration. To migrate away from the 'disk' source configuration, set `gitlab_pages['domain_config_source'] = "gitlab"` in your `/etc/gitlab/gitlab.rb` file. We recommend you migrate before updating to GitLab 14.0, to identify and troubleshoot any potential problems before upgrading.

    Previous work helped [align the vulnerabilities calls for pipeline security tabs](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/343469) to match the vulnerabilities calls for project-level and group-level vulnerability reports. This helped the frontend have a more consistent interface. The old `project.pipeline.securityReportFindings` query was formatted differently than other vulnerability data calls. Now that it has been replaced with the new `project.pipeline.vulnerabilities` field, the old `project.pipeline.securityReportFindings` is being deprecated and will be removed in GitLab 16.0.

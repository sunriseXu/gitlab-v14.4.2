A task gives instructions for how to complete a procedure.

Tasks should be in this format:

Do this task when you want to...

Prerequisites (optional):

- Thing 1
- Thing 2

To do this task:

1. Location then action. (Go to this menu, then select this item.)
1. Another step.
1. Another step.

Task result (optional). Next steps (optional).
```

Here is an example.

```markdown
# Create an issue

Create an issue when you want to track bugs or future work.

Prerequisites:

- You must have at least the Developer role for the project.

To create an issue:

1. On the top bar, select **Main menu > Projects** and find your project.
1. On the left sidebar, select **Issues > List**.
1. In the top right corner, select **New issue**.
1. Complete the fields. (If you have reference content that lists each field, link to it here.)
1. Select **Create issue**.

The issue is created. You can view it by going to **Issues > List**.
```

## Task headings

For the heading text, use the structure `active verb` + `noun`.
For example, `Create an issue`.

If you have several tasks on a page that share prerequisites, you can use the title
`Prerequisites` and link to it.

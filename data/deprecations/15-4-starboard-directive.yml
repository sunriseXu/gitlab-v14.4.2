  body: |
    GitLab's operational container scanning capabilities no longer require starboard to be installed. Consequently, use of the `starboard:` directive in the configuration file for the GitLab Agent for Kubernetes is now deprecated and is scheduled for removal in GitLab 16.0. Update your configuration file to use the `container_scanning:` directive.

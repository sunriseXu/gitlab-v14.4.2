    For those using Dependency Scanning for Python projects, we are removing support for the default `gemnasium-python:2` image which uses Python 3.6, as well as the custom `gemnasium-python:2-python-3.9` image which uses Python 3.9. The new default image as of GitLab 15.0 will be for Python 3.9 as it is a [supported version](https://endoflife.date/python) and 3.6 [is no longer supported](https://endoflife.date/python).

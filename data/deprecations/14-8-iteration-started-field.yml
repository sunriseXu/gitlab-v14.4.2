    The `started` field in the [iterations API](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/api/iterations.html#list-project-iterations) is being deprecated and will be removed in GitLab 15.0. This field is being replaced with the `current` field (already available) which aligns with the naming for other time-based entities, such as milestones.

# Code review analytics **(PREMIUM)**

> Moved to GitLab Premium in 13.9.

Use code review analytics to view review metrics per merge request and
make improvements to your code review process:

- A high number of comments or commits may indicate:
  - The code is too complex.
  - Authors who require more training.
- A long review time may indicate:
  - Types of work that move slower than other types.
  - Opportunities to accelerate your development cycle.
- Fewer comments and approvers may indicate staffing requirements.

Code review analytics displays a table of open merge requests that have at least one non-author comment.
The review time is measured from when the first non-author comment was submitted.

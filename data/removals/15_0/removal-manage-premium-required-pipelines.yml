   [Required pipeline configuration](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/admin_area/settings/continuous_integration.html#required-pipeline-configuration) helps to define and mandate organization-wide pipeline configurations and is a requirement at an executive and organizational level. To align better with our [pricing philosophy](https://about.gitlab.com/company/pricing/#three-tiers), this feature is removed from the Premium tier in GitLab 15.0. This feature continues to be available in the GitLab Ultimate tier.

   We recommend customers use [Compliance Pipelines](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/project/settings/index.html#compliance-pipeline-configuration), also in GitLab Ultimate, as an alternative as it provides greater flexibility, allowing required pipelines to be assigned to specific compliance framework labels.

   This change also helps GitLab remain consistent in our tiering strategy with the other related Ultimate-tier features:

   - [Security policies](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/application_security/policies/).
   - [Compliance framework pipelines](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/project/settings/index.html#compliance-pipeline-configuration).

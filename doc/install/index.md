# Install GitLab **(FREE SELF)**

You can install GitLab on most GNU/Linux distributions, on several
cloud providers, and in Kubernetes clusters.

To get the best experience, you should balance performance, reliability,
ease of administration (backups, upgrades, and troubleshooting) with the cost of hosting.

To get started, [choose your installation method](install_methods.md).

If you already have a running instance, learn how to [configure it](next_steps.md).

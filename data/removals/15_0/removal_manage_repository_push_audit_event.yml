    Audit events for [repository events](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/administration/audit_events.html#removed-events) are removed as of GitLab 15.0.

    Audit events for repository events were always disabled by default and had to be manually enabled with a feature flag.
    Enabling them could slow down GitLab instances by generating too many events. Therefore, they are removed.

    Please note that we will add high-volume audit events in the future as part of [streaming audit events](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/administration/audit_event_streaming.html). An example of this is how we will send [Git fetch actions](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/343984) as a streaming audit event. If you would be interested in seeing repository push events or some other action as a streaming audit event, please reach out to us!

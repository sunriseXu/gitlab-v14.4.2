# Troubleshooting topic type

Troubleshooting topics should be the last topics on a page.

If a page has more than five troubleshooting topics, put the content on a separate page that has troubleshooting information exclusively. Name the page `Troubleshooting <feature>`
and in the left nav, use the word `Troubleshoot` only.

Troubleshooting can be one of three types.

## An introductory topic

This topic introduces the troubleshooting section of a page.
For example:

```markdown
## Troubleshooting

When working with <x feature>, you might encounter the following issues.
```

## Troubleshooting task

The title should be similar to a [standard task](task.md).
For example, "Run debug tools" or "Verify syntax."

## Troubleshooting reference

This topic includes the error message. For example:

```markdown
### The error message or a description of it

You might get an error that states <error message>.

This issue occurs when...

The workaround is...
```

If multiple causes or workarounds exist, consider putting them into a table format.
If you use the exact error message, surround it in backticks so it's styled as code.

## Troubleshooting headings

For the heading of a **Troubleshooting reference** topic:

- Consider including at least a partial error message.
- Use fewer than 70 characters.

If you do not put the full error in the title, include it in the body text.

    We have now removed the deprecated legacy names for approval status of license policy (`blacklisted`, `approved`) in the API queries and responses. If you are using our License Compliance API you should stop using the `approved` and `blacklisted` query parameters, they are now `allowed` and `denied`. In 15.0 the responses will also stop using `approved` and `blacklisted` so you may need to adjust any of your custom tools.

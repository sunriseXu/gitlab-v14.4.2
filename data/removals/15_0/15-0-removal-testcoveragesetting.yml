     To specify a test coverage pattern, in GitLab 15.0 the
     [project setting for test coverage parsing](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/ci/pipelines/settings.html#add-test-coverage-results-to-a-merge-request-removed)
     has been removed.

     To set test coverage parsing, use the projectâ€™s `.gitlab-ci.yml` file by providing a regular expression with the
     [`coverage` keyword](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/ci/yaml/index.html#coverage).

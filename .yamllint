# Why disabling all of those rules?
#
# For the scope of https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/359968,
# we would like to catch syntax errors as soon as possible.
# Style "errors" are not as important right now, but they should ideally be added later on.
#
# Please consider enabling a rule, and fixing the issues you'll see in an MR.

    The `omniauth-kerberos` gem is no longer supported. This gem has not been maintained and has very little usage. Therefore, we
    removed support for this authentication method and recommend using [SPEGNO](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SPNEGO) instead. You can
    follow the [upgrade instructions](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/integration/kerberos.html#upgrading-from-password-based-to-ticket-based-kerberos-sign-ins)
    to upgrade from the removed integration to the new supported one.

    We are not removing Kerberos SPNEGO integration. We are removing the old password-based Kerberos.

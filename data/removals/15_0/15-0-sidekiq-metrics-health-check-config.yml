    In GitLab 15.0, you can no longer serve Sidekiq metrics and health checks over a single address and port.

    To improve stability, availability, and prevent data loss in edge cases, GitLab now serves
    [Sidekiq metrics and health checks from two separate servers](https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/6409).

    When you use Omnibus or Helm charts, if GitLab is configured for both servers to bind to the same address,
    a configuration error occurs.
    To prevent this error, choose different ports for the metrics and health check servers:

    - [Configure Sidekiq health checks](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/administration/sidekiq.html#configure-health-checks)
    - [Configure the Sidekiq metrics server](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/administration/sidekiq.html#configure-the-sidekiq-metrics-server)

    If you installed GitLab from source, verify manually that both servers are configured to bind to separate addresses and ports.

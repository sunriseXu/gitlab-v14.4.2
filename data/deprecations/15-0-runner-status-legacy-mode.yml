    The `legacyMode` argument to the `status` field in `RunnerType` will be rendered non-functional in the 16.0 release
    as part of the deprecations details in the [issue](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/351109).

    In GitLab 16.0 and later, the `status` field will act as if `legacyMode` is null. The `legacyMode` argument will
    be present during the 16.x cycle to avoid breaking the API signature, and will be removed altogether in the
    17.0 release.

   In GitLab 15.3, [security report schemas below version 15 were deprecated](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/update/deprecations.html#security-report-schemas-version-14xx).
   The `confidence` attribute on vulnerability findings exists only in schema versions before `15-0-0`, and therefore is effectively deprecated since GitLab 15.4 supports schema version `15-0-0`. To maintain consistency
   between the reports and our public APIs, the `confidence` attribute on any vulnerability-related components of our GraphQL API is now deprecated and will be
   removed in 16.0.

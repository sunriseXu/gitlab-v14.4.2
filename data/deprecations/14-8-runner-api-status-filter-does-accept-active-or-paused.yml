    The GitLab Runner REST endpoints will stop accepting `paused` or `active` as a status value in GitLab 16.0.

    A runner's status will only relate to runner contact status, such as: `online`, `offline`.
    Status values `paused` or `active` will no longer be accepted and will be replaced by the `paused` query parameter.

    When checking for paused runners, API users are advised to specify `paused=true` as the query parameter.
    When checking for active runners, specify `paused=false`.

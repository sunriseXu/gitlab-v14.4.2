    You can use the vulnerabilityFindingDismiss GraphQL mutation to set the status of a vulnerability finding to `Dismissed`. Previously, this mutation used the `id` field to identify findings uniquely. However, this did not work for dismissing findings from the pipeline security tab. Therefore, using the `id` field as an identifier has been dropped in favor of the `uuid` field. Using the 'uuid' field as an identifier allows you to dismiss the finding from the pipeline security tab.

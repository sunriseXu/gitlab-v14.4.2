    Our CI/CD templates have been updated to no longer use hard-coded references to a `master` branch. In 14.0, they all use a variable that points to your project's configured default branch instead. If your CI/CD pipeline relies on our built-in templates, verify that this change works with your current configuration. For example, if you have a `master` branch and a different default branch, the updates to the templates may cause changes to your pipeline behavior.

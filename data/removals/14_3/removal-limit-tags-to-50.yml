    GitLab values efficiency and is prioritizing reliability for [GitLab.com in FY22](https://about.gitlab.com/direction/#gitlab-hosted-first). In 14.3, GitLab CI/CD jobs must have less than 50 [tags](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/ci/yaml/index.html#tags). If a pipeline contains a job with 50 or more tags, you will receive an error and the pipeline will not be created.

# Harbor Registry **(FREE)**

You can integrate the [Harbor container registry](../../../user/project/integrations/harbor.md#harbor-container-registry-integration) into GitLab and use Harbor as the container registry for your GitLab project to store images.

## View the Harbor Registry

You can view the Harbor Registry for a project or group.

1. On the top bar, select **Main menu > Projects/Groups**.
1. Go to the project or group that you are interested in.
1. On the left sidebar, select **Packages and registries > Harbor Registry**.

You can search, sort, and filter images on this page. You can share a filtered view by copying the URL from your browser.

At the project level, you can see **CLI Commands** in the upper right corner, where you can copy
corresponding commands to log in, build images, and push images. **CLI Commands** is not shown at
the group level.

NOTE:
Default settings for the Harbor integration at the project level are inherited from the group level.

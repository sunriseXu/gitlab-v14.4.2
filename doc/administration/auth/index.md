# GitLab authentication and authorization **(FREE SELF)**

GitLab integrates with a number of [OmniAuth providers](../../integration/omniauth.md#supported-providers),
and the following external authentication and authorization providers:

- [LDAP](ldap/index.md): Includes Active Directory, Apple Open Directory, Open LDAP,
  and 389 Server.
  - [Google Secure LDAP](ldap/google_secure_ldap.md)
- [SAML for GitLab.com groups](../../user/group/saml_sso/index.md) **(PREMIUM SAAS)**
- [Smartcard](smartcard.md) **(PREMIUM SELF)**

NOTE:
UltraAuth has removed their software which supports OmniAuth integration. We have therefore removed all references to UltraAuth integration.

## SaaS vs Self-Managed Comparison

The external authentication and authorization providers may support the following capabilities.
For more information, see the links shown on this page for each external provider.

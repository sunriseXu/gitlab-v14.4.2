## Configure the Power-Up

To configure a Power-Up for a Trello board:

1. Go to your Trello board.
1. Select **Power-Ups** and find the **GitLab** row.
1. Select **Enable**.
1. Select **Settings** (the gear icon).
1. Select **Authorize Account**.
1. Enter the [GitLab API URL](#get-the-api-url) and [personal access token](../user/profile/personal_access_tokens.md#create-a-personal-access-token) with the **API** scope.
1. Select **Save**.

## Get the API URL

Your API URL is your GitLab instance URL with `/api/v4` appended at the end of the URL.
For example, if your GitLab instance URL is `https://gitlab.com`, your API URL is `https://gitlab.com/api/v4`.
If your instance URL is `https://example.com`, your API URL is `https://example.com/api/v4`.

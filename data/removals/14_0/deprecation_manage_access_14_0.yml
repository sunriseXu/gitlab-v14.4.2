    GitLab is deprecating the [OAuth 2 implicit grant flow](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/api/oauth2.html#implicit-grant-flow) as it has been removed for [OAuth 2.1](https://oauth.net/2.1/).

    Migrate your existing applications to other supported [OAuth2 flows](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/api/oauth2.html#supported-oauth2-flows).

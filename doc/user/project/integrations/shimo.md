# Shimo Workspace integration **(FREE)**

> - [Introduced](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/343386) in GitLab 14.5 with a feature flag named `shimo_integration`. Disabled by default.
> - [Enabled on GitLab.com](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/345356) in GitLab 15.4.
> - [Generally available](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/345356) in GitLab 15.4. [Feature flag `shimo_integration`](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/345356) removed.

[Shimo](https://shimo.im/) is a productivity suite that includes documents, spreadsheets, and slideshows in one interface. With this integration, you can use the Shimo Wiki directly within GitLab instead of the [GitLab group/project wiki](../wiki/index.md).

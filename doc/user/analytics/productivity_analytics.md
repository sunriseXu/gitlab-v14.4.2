# Productivity analytics **(PREMIUM)**

You can use productivity analytics to identify:

- Your development velocity based on how long it takes for a merge request to merge.
- The most time consuming merge requests and potential causes.
- Authors, labels, or milestones with the longest time to merge, or most changes.

Use productivity analytics to view the following merge request statistics for your groups:

- Amount of time between merge request creation and merge.
- Amount of time between commits, comments, and merge.
- Complexity of changes, like number of lines of code per commit and number of files.

To view merge request data for projects, use [Merge request analytics](../analytics/merge_request_analytics.md).

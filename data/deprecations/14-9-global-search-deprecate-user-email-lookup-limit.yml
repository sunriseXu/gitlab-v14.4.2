    The `user_email_lookup_limit` [API field](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/api/settings.html) is deprecated and will be removed in GitLab 15.0. Until GitLab 15.0, `user_email_lookup_limit` is aliased to `search_rate_limit` and existing workflows will continue to work.

    Any API calls attempting to change the rate limits for `user_email_lookup_limit` should use `search_rate_limit` instead.

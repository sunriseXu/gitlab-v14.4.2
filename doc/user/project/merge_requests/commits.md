# Commits tab in merge requests **(FREE)**

The **Commits** tab in a merge request displays a sequential list of commits
to the Git branch your merge request is based on. From this page, you can review
full commit messages and copy a commit's SHA when you need to
[cherry-pick changes](cherry_pick_changes.md).

## Merge requests commit navigation

> [Introduced](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/18140) in GitLab 13.0.

To seamlessly navigate among commits in a merge request:

1. Select the **Commits** tab.
1. Select a commit to open it in the single-commit view.
1. Navigate through the commits by either:

   - Selecting **Prev** and **Next** buttons below the tab buttons.
   - Using the <kbd>X</kbd> and <kbd>C</kbd> keyboard shortcuts.

## View merge request commits in context

> - [Introduced](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/29274) in GitLab 13.12 [with a flag](../../../administration/feature_flags.md) named `context_commits`. Enabled by default.
> - [Enabled on GitLab.com](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/320757) in GitLab 14.8.
> - [Generally available](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/320757) in GitLab 14.9. [Feature flag `context_commits`](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/320757) removed.

When reviewing a merge request, it helps to have more context about the changes
made. That includes unchanged lines in unchanged files, and previous commits
that have already merged that the change is built on.

To add previously merged commits to a merge request for more context:

1. Go to your merge request.
1. Select the **Commits** tab.
1. Scroll to the end of the list of commits, and select **Add previously merged commits**:

1. Select the commits that you want to add.
1. Select **Save changes**.

To view the changes done on those previously merged commits:

1. On your merge request, select the **Changes** tab.
1. Scroll to **(file-tree)** **Compare** and select **previously merged commits**:

# Purpose:
# - Reads a set of markdown examples from a hash which has been serialized to disk
# - Sets up the appropriate fixture data for the markdown examples
# - Converts each example to static HTML using the appropriate API markdown endpoint
# - Writes the HTML for each example to a hash which is serialized to disk
#
# Requirements:
# The input and output files are specified via these environment variables:
# - INPUT_MARKDOWN_YML_PATH
# - OUTPUT_STATIC_HTML_TEMPFILE_PATH
#
# Although it is implemented as an RSpec test, it is not a unit test. We use
# RSpec because that is the simplest environment in which we can use the
# Factorybot factory methods to create persisted model objects with stable
# and consistent data values, to ensure consistent example snapshot HTML
# across various machines and environments. RSpec also makes it easy to invoke
# the API # and obtain the response.
#
# It is intended to be invoked as a helper subprocess from the `update_example_snapshots.rb`
# script class. It's not intended to be run or used directly. This usage is also reinforced
# by not naming the file with a `_spec.rb` ending.

    We have removed support for retire.js from Dependency Scanning as of May 22, 2022 in GitLab 15.0. JavaScript scanning functionality will not be affected as it is still being covered by Gemnasium.

    If you have explicitly excluded retire.js using the `DS_EXCLUDED_ANALYZERS` variable, then you will be able to remove the reference to retire.js. If you have customized your pipelineâ€™s Dependency Scanning configuration related to the `retire-js-dependency_scanning` job, then you will want to switch to `gemnasium-dependency_scanning`. If you have not used the `DS_EXCLUDED_ANALYZERS` to reference retire.js, or customized your template specifically for retire.js, you will not need to take any action.

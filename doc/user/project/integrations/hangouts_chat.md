# Google Chat integration **(FREE)**

Integrate your project to send notifications from GitLab to a
room of your choice in [Google Chat](https://chat.google.com/) (former Google
Hangouts).

## Integration workflow

To enable this integration, first you need to create a webhook for the room in
Google Chat where you want to receive the notifications from your project.

After that, enable the integration in GitLab and choose the events you want to
be notified about in your Google Chat room.

For every selected event in your project, GitLab acts like a bot sending
notifications to Google Chat:

### Enable threads in Google Chat

To enable threaded notifications for the same GitLab object (for example, an issue or merge request):

1. In **Spaces**, select **+ > Create space**.
1. Enter the space name and (optionally) other details, and select **Use threaded replies**.

You cannot enable threaded replies for existing Google Chat spaces.

## Enable the integration in GitLab

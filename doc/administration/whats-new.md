# What's new **(FREE)**

You can view some of the highlights from the last 10
GitLab versions in the **What's new** feature. It lists new features available in different
[GitLab tiers](https://about.gitlab.com/pricing/).

All users can see the feature list, but the entries might differ depending on the subscription type:

- Features only available on GitLab.com are not shown to self-managed installations.
- Features only available to self-managed installations are not shown on GitLab.com.

   NOTE:
   For self-managed installations, the updated **What's new** is included
   in the first patch release after a new version, such as `13.10.1`.

# Reference topic type

Reference information should be in an easily-scannable format,
like a table or list. It's similar to a dictionary or encyclopedia entry.

```markdown
# Title (a noun, like "Pipeline settings" or "Administrator options")

Introductory sentence.

| Setting | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **Name** | Descriptive sentence about the setting. |
```

## Reference headings

Reference headings are usually nouns.

Avoid these heading titles:

- `Important notes`. Instead, incorporate this information
  closer to where it belongs. For example, this information might be a prerequisite
  for a task, or information about a concept.
- `Limitations`. Instead, move the content near other similar information.
  If you must, you can use the title `Known issues`.

# DAST API **(ULTIMATE)**

You can add dynamic application security testing (DAST) of web APIs to your
[GitLab CI/CD](../../../ci/index.md) pipelines. This helps you discover bugs and potential security
issues that other QA processes may miss.

We recommend that you use DAST API testing in addition to [GitLab Secure](../index.md)'s
other security scanners and your own test processes. If you're using [GitLab CI/CD](../../../ci/index.md),
you can run DAST API tests as part your CI/CD workflow.

WARNING:
Do not run DAST API testing against a production server. Not only can it perform *any* function that
the API can, it may also trigger bugs in the API. This includes actions like modifying and deleting
data. Only run DAST API against a test server.

You can run DAST API scanning against the following web API types:

- REST API
- SOAP
- GraphQL
- Form bodies, JSON, or XML

## When DAST API scans run

DAST API scanning runs in the `dast` stage by default. To ensure DAST API scanning examines the latest
code, ensure your CI/CD pipeline deploys changes to a test environment in a stage before the `dast`
stage.

If your pipeline is configured to deploy to the same web server on each run, running a pipeline
while another is still running could cause a race condition in which one pipeline overwrites the
code from another. The API to be scanned should be excluded from changes for the duration of a
DAST API scan. The only changes to the API should be from the DAST API scanner. Changes made to the
API (for example, by users, scheduled tasks, database changes, code changes, other pipelines, or
other scanners) during a scan could cause inaccurate results.

## Example DAST API scanning configurations

The following projects demonstrate DAST API scanning:

- [Example OpenAPI v2 Specification project](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/security-products/demos/api-dast/openapi-example)
- [Example HTTP Archive (HAR) project](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/security-products/demos/api-dast/har-example)
- [Example Postman Collection project](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/security-products/demos/api-dast/postman-example)
- [Example GraphQL project](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/security-products/demos/api-dast/graphql-example)
- [Example SOAP project](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/security-products/demos/api-dast/soap-example)

## Targeting API for DAST scanning

You can specify the API you want to scan by using:

- [OpenAPI v2 or v3 Specification](#openapi-specification)
- [GraphQL Schema](#graphql-schema)
- [HTTP Archive (HAR)](#http-archive-har)
- [Postman Collection v2.0 or v2.1](#postman-collection)

### OpenAPI Specification

> - Support for OpenAPI Specification using YAML format was [introduced](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/330583) in GitLab 14.0.
> - Support to generate media type `application/xml` was [introduced](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/327268) in GitLab 14.8.
> - Support to media types was [introduced](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/333304) in GitLab 14.10.

The [OpenAPI Specification](https://www.openapis.org/) (formerly the Swagger Specification) is an API description format for REST APIs.
This section shows you how to configure DAST API scanning using an OpenAPI Specification to provide information about the target API to test.
OpenAPI Specifications are provided as a file system resource or URL. Both JSON and YAML OpenAPI formats are supported.

DAST API uses an OpenAPI document to generate the request body. When a request body is required,
the body generation is limited to these body types:

- `application/x-www-form-urlencoded`
- `multipart/form-data`
- `application/json`
- `application/xml`

### OpenAPI and media types

A media type (formerly known as MIME type) is an identifier for file formats and format contents transmitted. A OpenAPI document lets you specify that a given operation can accept different media types, hence a given request can send data using different file content. As for example, a `PUT /user` operation to update user data could accept data in either XML (media type `application/xml`) or JSON (media type `application/json`) format.
OpenAPI 2.x lets you specify the accepted media types globally or per operation, and OpenAPI 3.x lets you specify the accepted media types per operation. DAST API will check the listed media types, and try to produce sample data for each supported media type.

- In [GitLab 14.10 and later](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/333304), the default behavior is to select one of the supported media types to use. The first supported media type is chosen from the list. This behavior is configurable.
- In GitLab 14.9 and earlier, the default behavior is to perform testing using all supported media types. This means if two media types are listed (for example, `application/json` and `application/xml`), testing are performed using JSON, and then the same tests using XML.

Testing the same operation (for example, `POST /user`) using different media types (for example, `application/json` and `application/xml`) is not always desirable.
For example, if the target application executes the same code regardless of the request content type, it will take longer to finish the test session, and it may report duplicated vulnerabilities related to the request body depending on the target app.

The environment variable `DAST_API_OPENAPI_ALL_MEDIA_TYPES` lets you specify whether or not to use all supported media types instead of one when generating requests for a given operation. When the environment variable `DAST_API_OPENAPI_ALL_MEDIA_TYPES` is set to any value, DAST API tries to generate requests for all supported media types instead of one in a given operation. This will cause testing to take longer as testing is repeated for each provided media type.

Alternatively, the variable `DAST_API_OPENAPI_MEDIA_TYPES` is used to provide a list of media types that will each be tested. Providing more than one media type causes testing to take longer, as testing is performed for each media type selected. When the environment variable `DAST_API_OPENAPI_MEDIA_TYPES` is set to a list of media types, only the listed media types are included when creating requests.

Multiple media types in `DAST_API_OPENAPI_MEDIA_TYPES` are separated by a colon (`:`). For example, to limit request generation to the media types `application/x-www-form-urlencoded` and  `multipart/form-data`, set the environment variable `DAST_API_OPENAPI_MEDIA_TYPES` to `application/x-www-form-urlencoded:multipart/form-data`. Only supported media types in this list are included when creating requests, though non-supported media types are always skipped. A media type text may contain different sections. For example, `application/vnd.api+json; charset=UTF-8`, is a compound of `type "/" [tree "."] subtype ["+" suffix]* [";" parameter]`. Parameters are not taken into account when performing the filtering media types on request generation.

The environment variables `DAST_API_OPENAPI_ALL_MEDIA_TYPES` and `DAST_API_OPENAPI_MEDIA_TYPES` allow you to decide how to handle media types. These settings are mutually exclusive. If both are enabled, DAST API reports an error.

#### Configure DAST API with an OpenAPI Specification

To configure DAST API scanning with an OpenAPI specification:

To configure DAST API scanning with an OpenAPI Specification:

1. [Include](../../../ci/yaml/index.md#includetemplate)
   the [`DAST-API.gitlab-ci.yml` template](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/blob/master/lib/gitlab/ci/templates/Security/DAST-API.gitlab-ci.yml) in your `.gitlab-ci.yml` file.

1. The [configuration file](#configuration-files) has several testing profiles defined with different checks enabled. We recommend that you start with the `Quick` profile.
   Testing with this profile completes faster, allowing for easier configuration validation.
   Provide the profile by adding the `DAST_API_PROFILE` CI/CD variable to your `.gitlab-ci.yml` file.

1. Provide the location of the OpenAPI Specification as either a file or URL.
   Specify the location by adding the `DAST_API_OPENAPI` variable.

1. The target API instance's base URL is also required. Provide it by using the `DAST_API_TARGET_URL`
   variable or an `environment_url.txt` file.

   Adding the URL in an `environment_url.txt` file at your project's root is great for testing in
   dynamic environments. To run DAST API against an app dynamically created during a GitLab CI/CD
   pipeline, have the app persist its URL in an `environment_url.txt` file. DAST API
   automatically parses that file to find its scan target. You can see an
   [example of this in our Auto DevOps CI YAML](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/blob/master/lib/gitlab/ci/templates/Jobs/Deploy.gitlab-ci.yml).

Complete example configuration of using an OpenAPI Specification:

```yaml
stages:
  - dast

include:
  - template: DAST-API.gitlab-ci.yml

variables:
  DAST_API_PROFILE: Quick
  DAST_API_OPENAPI: test-api-specification.json
  DAST_API_TARGET_URL: http://test-deployment/
```

This is a minimal configuration for DAST API. From here you can:

- [Run your first scan](#running-your-first-scan).
- [Add authentication](#authentication).
- Learn how to [handle false positives](#handling-false-positives).

### HTTP Archive (HAR)

The [HTTP Archive format (HAR)](../api_fuzzing/create_har_files.md) is an archive file format for
logging HTTP transactions. When used with the GitLab DAST API scanner, the HAR file must contain
records of calling the web API to test. The DAST API scanner extracts all of the requests and uses them
to perform testing.

You can use various tools to generate HAR files:

- [Insomnia Core](https://insomnia.rest/): API client
- [Chrome](https://www.google.com/chrome/): Browser
- [Firefox](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/): Browser
- [Fiddler](https://www.telerik.com/fiddler): Web debugging proxy
- [GitLab HAR Recorder](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/security-products/har-recorder): Command line

WARNING:
HAR files may contain sensitive information such as authentication tokens, API keys, and session
cookies. We recommend that you review the HAR file contents before adding them to a repository.

#### DAST API scanning with a HAR file

To configure DAST API to use a HAR file that provides information about the target API to test:

1. [Include](../../../ci/yaml/index.md#includetemplate)
   the [`DAST-API.gitlab-ci.yml` template](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/blob/master/lib/gitlab/ci/templates/Security/DAST-API.gitlab-ci.yml) in your `.gitlab-ci.yml` file.

1. The [configuration file](#configuration-files) has several testing profiles defined with different checks enabled. We recommend that you start with the `Quick` profile.
   Testing with this profile completes faster, allowing for easier configuration validation.

   Provide the profile by adding the `DAST_API_PROFILE` CI/CD variable to your `.gitlab-ci.yml` file.

1. Provide the location of the HAR file. You can provide the location as a file path
   or URL. [URL support was introduced](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/285020) in GitLab 13.10 and later. Specify the location by adding the `DAST_API_HAR` variable.

1. The target API instance's base URL is also required. Provide it by using the `DAST_API_TARGET_URL`
   variable or an `environment_url.txt` file.

   Adding the URL in an `environment_url.txt` file at your project's root is great for testing in
   dynamic environments. To run DAST API against an app dynamically created during a GitLab CI/CD
   pipeline, have the app persist its URL in an `environment_url.txt` file. DAST API
   automatically parses that file to find its scan target. You can see an
   [example of this in our Auto DevOps CI YAML](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/blob/master/lib/gitlab/ci/templates/Jobs/Deploy.gitlab-ci.yml).

Complete example configuration of using an HAR file:

```yaml
stages:
  - dast

include:
  - template: DAST-API.gitlab-ci.yml

variables:
  DAST_API_PROFILE: Quick
  DAST_API_HAR: test-api-recording.har
  DAST_API_TARGET_URL: http://test-deployment/
```

This example is a minimal configuration for DAST API. From here you can:

- [Run your first scan](#running-your-first-scan).
- [Add authentication](#authentication).
- Learn how to [handle false positives](#handling-false-positives).

### GraphQL Schema

> Support for GraphQL Schema was [introduced](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/352780) in GitLab 15.4.

GraphQL is a query language for your API and an alternative to REST APIs.
DAST API supports testing GraphQL endpoints multiple ways:

- Test using the GraphQL Schema. [Introduced](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/352780) in GitLab 15.4.
- Test using a recording (HAR) of GraphQL queries.
- Test using a Postman Collection containing GraphQL queries.

This section documents how to test using a GraphQL schema. The GraphQL schema support in
DAST API is able to query the schema from endpoints that support introspection.
Introspection is enabled by default to allow tools like GraphiQL to work.

#### DAST API scanning with a GraphQL endpoint URL

The GraphQL support in DAST API is able to query a GraphQL endpoint for the schema.

NOTE:
The GraphQL endpoint must support introspection queries for this method to work correctly.

To configure DAST API to use a GraphQL endpoint URL that provides information about the target API to test:

1. [Include](../../../ci/yaml/index.md#includetemplate)
   the [`DAST-API.gitlab-ci.yml` template](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/blob/master/lib/gitlab/ci/templates/Security/DAST-API.gitlab-ci.yml) in your `.gitlab-ci.yml` file.

1. Provide the path to the GraphQL endpoint, for example `/api/graphql`. Specify the location by adding the `DAST_API_GRAPHQL` variable.

1. The target API instance's base URL is also required. Provide it by using the `DAST_API_TARGET_URL`
   variable or an `environment_url.txt` file.

   Adding the URL in an `environment_url.txt` file at your project's root is great for testing in
   dynamic environments. See the [dynamic environment solutions](#dynamic-environment-solutions) section of our documentation for more information.

Complete example configuration of using a GraphQL endpoint path:

```yaml
stages:
  - dast

include:
  - template: DAST-API.gitlab-ci.yml

dast_api:
  variables:
    DAST_API_GRAPHQL: /api/graphql
    DAST_API_TARGET_URL: http://test-deployment/
```

This example is a minimal configuration for DAST API. From here you can:

- [Run your first scan](#running-your-first-scan).
- [Add authentication](#authentication).
- Learn how to [handle false positives](#handling-false-positives).

#### DAST API scanning with a GraphQL Schema file

To configure DAST API to use a GraphQL schema file that provides information about the target API to test:

1. [Include](../../../ci/yaml/index.md#includetemplate)
   the [`DAST-API.gitlab-ci.yml` template](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/blob/master/lib/gitlab/ci/templates/Security/DAST-API.gitlab-ci.yml) in your `.gitlab-ci.yml` file.

1. Provide the GraphQL endpoint path, for example  `/api/graphql`. Specify the path by adding the `DAST_API_GRAPHQL` variable.

1. Provide the location of the GraphQL schema file. You can provide the location as a file path
   or URL. Specify the location by adding the `DAST_API_GRAPHQL_SCHEMA` variable.

1. The target API instance's base URL is also required. Provide it by using the `DAST_API_TARGET_URL`
   variable or an `environment_url.txt` file.

   Adding the URL in an `environment_url.txt` file at your project's root is great for testing in
   dynamic environments. See the [dynamic environment solutions](#dynamic-environment-solutions) section of our documentation for more information.

Complete example configuration of using an GraphQL schema file:

  - template: DAST-API.gitlab-ci.yml

dast_api:
  variables:
    DAST_API_GRAPHQL: /api/graphql
    DAST_API_GRAPHQL_SCHEMA: test-api-graphql.schema
    DAST_API_TARGET_URL: http://test-deployment/
```

Complete example configuration of using an GraphQL schema file URL:

```

This example is a minimal configuration for DAST API. From here you can:

- [Run your first scan](#running-your-first-scan).
- [Add authentication](#authentication).
- Learn how to [handle false positives](#handling-false-positives).

### Postman Collection

The [Postman API Client](https://www.postman.com/product/api-client/) is a popular tool that
developers and testers use to call various types of APIs. The API definitions
[can be exported as a Postman Collection file](https://learning.postman.com/docs/getting-started/importing-and-exporting-data/#exporting-postman-data)
for use with DAST API. When exporting, make sure to select a supported version of Postman
Collection: v2.0 or v2.1.

When used with the GitLab DAST API scanner, Postman Collections must contain definitions of the web API to
test with valid data. The DAST API scanner extracts all the API definitions and uses them to perform
testing.

WARNING:
Postman Collection files may contain sensitive information such as authentication tokens, API keys,
and session cookies. We recommend that you review the Postman Collection file contents before adding
them to a repository.

#### DAST API scanning with a Postman Collection file

To configure DAST API to use a Postman Collection file that provides information about the target
API to test:

1. [Include](../../../ci/yaml/index.md#includetemplate)
   the [`DAST-API.gitlab-ci.yml` template](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/blob/master/lib/gitlab/ci/templates/Security/DAST-API.gitlab-ci.yml).

1. The [configuration file](#configuration-files) has several testing profiles defined with different checks enabled. We recommend that you start with the `Quick` profile.
   Testing with this profile completes faster, allowing for easier configuration validation.

   Provide the profile by adding the `DAST_API_PROFILE` CI/CD variable to your `.gitlab-ci.yml` file.

1. Provide the location of the Postman Collection file as either a file or URL. Specify the location by adding the `DAST_API_POSTMAN_COLLECTION` variable.

1. The target API instance's base URL is also required. Provide it by using the `DAST_API_TARGET_URL`
   variable or an `environment_url.txt` file.

   Adding the URL in an `environment_url.txt` file at your project's root is great for testing in
   dynamic environments. To run DAST API against an app dynamically created during a GitLab CI/CD
   pipeline, have the app persist its URL in an `environment_url.txt` file. DAST API
   automatically parses that file to find its scan target. You can see an
   [example of this in our Auto DevOps CI YAML](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/blob/master/lib/gitlab/ci/templates/Jobs/Deploy.gitlab-ci.yml).

Complete example configuration of using a Postman collection:

```yaml
stages:
  - dast

include:
  - template: DAST-API.gitlab-ci.yml

variables:
  DAST_API_PROFILE: Quick
  DAST_API_POSTMAN_COLLECTION: postman-collection_serviceA.json
  DAST_API_TARGET_URL: http://test-deployment/
```

This is a minimal configuration for DAST API. From here you can:

- [Run your first scan](#running-your-first-scan).
- [Add authentication](#authentication).
- Learn how to [handle false positives](#handling-false-positives).

#### Postman variables

> - Support for Postman Environment file format was [introduced](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/356312) in GitLab 15.1.
> - Support for multiple variable files was [introduced](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/356312) in GitLab 15.1.
> - Support for Postman variable scopes: Global and Environment was [introduced](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/356312) in GitLab 15.1.

##### Variables in Postman Client

Postman allows the developer to define placeholders that can be used in different parts of the
requests. These placeholders are called variables, as explained in [using variables](https://learning.postman.com/docs/sending-requests/variables/).
You can use variables to store and reuse values in your requests and scripts. For example, you can
edit the collection to add variables to the document:

![Edit collection variable tab View](img/dast_api_postman_collection_edit_variable.png)

Or alternatively, you can add variables in an environment:

![Edit environment variables View](img/dast_api_postman_environment_edit_variable.png)

You can then use the variables in sections such as URL, headers, and others:

![Edit request using variables View](img/dast_api_postman_request_edit.png)

Postman has grown from a basic client tool with a nice UX experience to a more complex ecosystem that allows testing APIs with scripts, creating complex collections that trigger secondary requests, and setting variables along the way. Not every feature in the Postman ecosystem is supported. For example, scripts are not supported. The main focus of the Postman support is to ingest Postman Collection definitions that are used by the Postman Client and their related variables defined in the workspace, environments, and the collections themselves.

Postman allows creating variables in different scopes. Each scope has a different level of visibility in the Postman tools. For example, you can create a variable in a _global environment_ scope that is seen by every operation definition and workspace. You can also create a variable in a specific _environment_ scope that is only visible and used when that specific environment is selected for use. Some scopes are not always available, for example in the Postman ecosystem you can create requests in the Postman Client, these requests do not have a _local_ scope, but test scripts do.

Variable scopes in Postman can be a daunting topic and not everyone is familiar with it. We strongly recommend that you read [Variable Scopes](https://learning.postman.com/docs/sending-requests/variables/#variable-scopes) from Postman documentation before moving forward.

As mentioned above, there are different variable scopes, and each of them has a purpose and can be used to provide more flexibility to your Postman document. There is an important note on how values for variables are computed, as per Postman documentation:

> If a variable with the same name is declared in two different scopes, the value stored in the variable with narrowest scope is used. For example, if there is a global variable named `username` and a local variable named `username`, the local value is used when the request runs.

The following is a summary of the variable scopes supported by the Postman Client and DAST API:

- **Global Environment (Global) scope** is a special pre-defined environment that is available throughout a workspace. We can also refer to the _global environment_ scope as the _global_ scope. The Postman Client allows exporting the global environment into a JSON file, which can be used with DAST API.
- **Environment scope** is a named group of variables created by a user in the Postman Client.
The Postman Client supports a single active environment along with the global environment. The variables defined in an active user-created environment take precedence over variables defined in the global environment. The Postman Client allows exporting your environment into a JSON file, which can be used with DAST API.
- **Collection scope** is a group of variables declared in a given collection. The collection variables are available to the collection where they have been declared and the nested requests or collections. Variables defined in the collection scope take precedence over the _global environment_ scope and also the _environment_ scope.
The Postman Client can export one or more collections into a JSON file, this JSON file contains selected collections, requests, and collection variables.
- **DAST API Scope** is a new scope added by DAST API to allow users to provide extra variables, or override variables defined in other supported scopes. This scope is not supported by Postman. The _DAST API Scope_ variables are provided using a [custom JSON file format](#dast-api-scope-custom-json-file-format).
  - Override values defined in the environment or collection
  - Defining variables from scripts
  - Define a single row of data from the unsupported _data scope_
- **Data scope** is a group of variables in which their name and values come from JSON or CSV files. A Postman collection runner like [Newman](https://learning.postman.com/docs/running-collections/using-newman-cli/command-line-integration-with-newman/) or [Postman Collection Runner](https://learning.postman.com/docs/running-collections/intro-to-collection-runs/) executes the requests in a collection as many times as entries have the JSON or CSV file. A good use case for these variables is to automate tests using scripts in Postman.
DAST API does **not** support reading data from a CSV or JSON file.
- **Local scope** are variables that are defined in Postman scripts. DAST API does **not** support Postman scripts and by extension, variables defined in scripts. You can still provide values for the script-defined variables by defining them in one of the supported scopes, or our custom JSON format.

Not all scopes are supported by DAST API and variables defined in scripts are not supported. The following table is sorted by broadest scope to narrowest scope.

| Scope              |Postman    | DAST API     | Comment  |
| ------------------ |:---------:|:------------:| :--------|
| Global Environment | Yes       | Yes          | Special pre-defined environment |
| Environment        | Yes       | Yes          | Named environments |
| Collection         | Yes       | Yes          | Defined in your postman collection |
| DAST API Scope     | No        | Yes          | Custom scope added by DAST API |
| Data               | Yes       | No           | External files in CSV or JSON format |
| Local              | Yes       | No           | Variables defined in scripts |

For more details on how to define variables and export variables in different scopes, see:

- [Defining collection variables](https://learning.postman.com/docs/sending-requests/variables/#defining-collection-variables)
- [Defining environment variables](https://learning.postman.com/docs/sending-requests/variables/#defining-environment-variables)
- [Defining global variables](https://learning.postman.com/docs/sending-requests/variables/#defining-global-variables)

##### Exporting from Postman Client

The Postman Client lets you export different file formats, for instance, you can export a Postman collection or a Postman environment.
The exported environment can be the global environment (which is always available) or can be any custom environment you previously have created. When you export a Postman Collection, it may contain only declarations for _collection_ and _local_ scoped variables; _environment_ scoped variables are not included.

To get the declaration for _environment_ scoped variables, you have to export a given environment at the time. Each exported file only includes variables from the selected environment.

For more details on exporting variables in different supported scopes, see:

- [Exporting collections](https://learning.postman.com/docs/getting-started/importing-and-exporting-data/#exporting-collections)
- [Exporting environments](https://learning.postman.com/docs/getting-started/importing-and-exporting-data/#exporting-environments)
- [Downloading global environments](https://learning.postman.com/docs/sending-requests/variables/#downloading-global-environments)

##### DAST API Scope, custom JSON file format

Our custom JSON file format is a JSON object where each object property represents a variable name and the property value represents the variable value. This file can be created using your favorite text editor, or it can be produced by an earlier job in your pipeline.

This example defines two variables `base_url` and `token` in the DAST API scope:

```json
{
  "base_url": "http://127.0.0.1/",
  "token": "Token 84816165151"
}
```

##### Using scopes with DAST API

The scopes: _global_, _environment_, _collection_, and _GitLab DAST API_ are supported in [GitLab 15.1 and later](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/356312). GitLab 15.0 and earlier, supports only the _collection_, and _GitLab DAST API_ scopes.

The following table provides a quick reference for mapping scope files/URLs to DAST API configuration variables:

| Scope              |  How to Provide |
| ------------------ | --------------- |
| Global Environment | DAST_API_POSTMAN_COLLECTION_VARIABLES |
| Environment        | DAST_API_POSTMAN_COLLECTION_VARIABLES |
| Collection         | DAST_API_POSTMAN_COLLECTION           |
| DAST API Scope     | DAST_API_POSTMAN_COLLECTION_VARIABLES |
| Data               | Not supported   |
| Local              | Not supported   |

The Postman Collection document automatically includes any _collection_ scoped variables. The Postman Collection is provided with the configuration variable `DAST_API_POSTMAN_COLLECTION`. This variable can be set to a single [exported Postman collection](https://learning.postman.com/docs/getting-started/importing-and-exporting-data/#exporting-collections).

Variables from other scopes are provided through the `DAST_API_POSTMAN_COLLECTION_VARIABLES` configuration variable. The configuration variable supports a comma (`,`) delimited file list in [GitLab 15.1 and later](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/356312). GitLab 15.0 and earlier, supports only one single file. The order of the files provided is not important as the files provide the needed scope information.

The configuration variable `DAST_API_POSTMAN_COLLECTION_VARIABLES` can be set to:

- [Exported Global environment](https://learning.postman.com/docs/sending-requests/variables/#downloading-global-environments)
- [Exported environments](https://learning.postman.com/docs/getting-started/importing-and-exporting-data/#exporting-environments)
- [DAST API Custom JSON format](#dast-api-scope-custom-json-file-format)

##### Undefined Postman variables

There is a chance that DAST API engine does not find all variables references that your Postman collection file is using. Some cases can be:

- You are using _data_ or _local_ scoped variables, and as stated previously these scopes are not supported by DAST API. Thus, assuming the values for these variables have not been provided through [the DAST API scope](#dast-api-scope-custom-json-file-format), then the values of the _data_ and _local_ scoped variables are undefined.
- A variable name was typed incorrectly, and the name does not match the defined variable.
- Postman Client supports a new dynamic variable that is not supported by DAST API.

When possible, DAST API follows the same behavior as the Postman Client does when dealing with undefined variables. The text of the variable reference remains the same, and there is no text substitution. The same behavior also applies to any unsupported dynamic variables.

For example, if a request definition in the Postman Collection references the variable `{{full_url}}` and the variable is not found it is left unchanged with the value `{{full_url}}`.

##### Dynamic Postman variables

In addition to variables that a user can define at various scope levels, Postman has a set of pre-defined variables called _dynamic_ variables. The [_dynamic_ variables](https://learning.postman.com/docs/writing-scripts/script-references/variables-list/) are already defined and their name is prefixed with a dollar sign (`$`), for instance, `$guid`. _Dynamic_ variables can be used like any other variable, and in the Postman Client, they produce random values during the request/collection run.

An important difference between DAST API and Postman is that DAST API returns the same value for each usage of the same dynamic variables. This differs from the Postman Client behavior which returns a random value on each use of the same dynamic variable. In other words, DAST API uses static values for dynamic variables while Postman uses random values.

The supported dynamic variables during the scanning process are:

##### Example: Global Scope

In this example, [the _global_ scope is exported](https://learning.postman.com/docs/sending-requests/variables/#downloading-global-environments) from the Postman Client as `global-scope.json` and provided to DAST API through the `DAST_API_POSTMAN_COLLECTION_VARIABLES` configuration variable.

Here is an example of using `DAST_API_POSTMAN_COLLECTION_VARIABLES`:

```yaml
stages:
  - dast

include:
  - template: DAST-API.gitlab-ci.yml

variables:
  DAST_API_PROFILE: Quick
  DAST_API_POSTMAN_COLLECTION: postman-collection.json
  DAST_API_POSTMAN_COLLECTION_VARIABLES: global-scope.json
  DAST_API_TARGET_URL: http://test-deployment/
```

##### Example: Environment Scope

In this example, [the _environment_ scope is exported](https://learning.postman.com/docs/getting-started/importing-and-exporting-data/#exporting-environments) from the Postman Client as `environment-scope.json` and provided to DAST API through the `DAST_API_POSTMAN_COLLECTION_VARIABLES` configuration variable.

Here is an example of using `DAST_API_POSTMAN_COLLECTION_VARIABLES`:

```yaml
stages:
  - dast

include:
  - template: DAST-API.gitlab-ci.yml

variables:
  DAST_API_PROFILE: Quick
  DAST_API_POSTMAN_COLLECTION: postman-collection.json
  DAST_API_POSTMAN_COLLECTION_VARIABLES: environment-scope.json
  DAST_API_TARGET_URL: http://test-deployment/
```

##### Example: Collection Scope

The _collection_ scope variables are included in the exported Postman Collection file and provided through the `DAST_API_POSTMAN_COLLECTION` configuration variable.

Here is an example of using `DAST_API_POSTMAN_COLLECTION`:

```yaml
stages:
  - dast

include:
  - template: DAST-API.gitlab-ci.yml

variables:
  DAST_API_PROFILE: Quick
  DAST_API_POSTMAN_COLLECTION: postman-collection.json
  DAST_API_TARGET_URL: http://test-deployment/
```

##### Example: DAST API Scope

The DAST API Scope is used for two main purposes, defining _data_ and _local_ scope variables that are not supported by DAST API, and changing the value of an existing variable defined in another scope. The DAST API Scope is provided through the `DAST_API_POSTMAN_COLLECTION_VARIABLES` configuration variable.

Here is an example of using `DAST_API_POSTMAN_COLLECTION_VARIABLES`:

```yaml
stages:
  - dast

include:
  - template: DAST-API.gitlab-ci.yml

variables:
  DAST_API_PROFILE: Quick
  DAST_API_POSTMAN_COLLECTION: postman-collection.json
  DAST_API_POSTMAN_COLLECTION_VARIABLES: dast-api-scope.json
  DAST_API_TARGET_URL: http://test-deployment/
```

The file `dast-api-scope.json` uses our [custom JSON file format](#dast-api-scope-custom-json-file-format). This JSON is an object with key-value pairs for properties. The keys are the variables' names, and the values are the variables'
values. For example:

```json
{
  "base_url": "http://127.0.0.1/",
  "token": "Token 84816165151"
}
```

##### Example: Multiple Scopes

In this example, a _global_ scope, _environment_ scope, and _collection_ scope are configured. The first step is to export our various scopes.

- [Export the _global_ scope](https://learning.postman.com/docs/sending-requests/variables/#downloading-global-environments) as `global-scope.json`
- [Export the _environment_ scope](https://learning.postman.com/docs/getting-started/importing-and-exporting-data/#exporting-environments) as `environment-scope.json`
- Export the Postman Collection which includes the _collection_ scope as `postman-collection.json`

The Postman Collection is provided using the `DAST_API_POSTMAN_COLLECTION` variable, while the other scopes are provided using the `DAST_API_POSTMAN_COLLECTION_VARIABLES`. DAST API can identify which scope the provided files match using data provided in each file.

```yaml
stages:
  - dast

include:
  - template: DAST-API.gitlab-ci.yml

variables:
  DAST_API_PROFILE: Quick
  DAST_API_POSTMAN_COLLECTION: postman-collection.json
  DAST_API_POSTMAN_COLLECTION_VARIABLES: global-scope.json,environment-scope.json
  DAST_API_TARGET_URL: http://test-deployment/
```

##### Example: Changing a Variables Value

When using exported scopes, it's often the case that the value of a variable must be changed for use with DAST API. For example, a _collection_ scoped variable might contain a variable named `api_version` with a value of `v2`, while your test needs a value of `v1`. Instead of modifying the exported collection to change the value, the DAST API scope can be used to change its value. This works because the _DAST API_ scope takes precedence over all other scopes.

The _collection_ scope variables are included in the exported Postman Collection file and provided through the `DAST_API_POSTMAN_COLLECTION` configuration variable.

The DAST API Scope is provided through the `DAST_API_POSTMAN_COLLECTION_VARIABLES` configuration variable, but first, we must create the file.
The file `dast-api-scope.json` uses our [custom JSON file format](#dast-api-scope-custom-json-file-format). This JSON is an object with key-value pairs for properties. The keys are the variables' names, and the values are the variables'
values. For example:

```json
{
  "api_version": "v1"
}
```

Our CI definition:

```yaml
stages:
  - dast

include:
  - template: DAST-API.gitlab-ci.yml

variables:
  DAST_API_PROFILE: Quick
  DAST_API_POSTMAN_COLLECTION: postman-collection.json
  DAST_API_POSTMAN_COLLECTION_VARIABLES: dast-api-scope.json
  DAST_API_TARGET_URL: http://test-deployment/
```

##### Example: Changing a Variables Value with Multiple Scopes

When using exported scopes, it's often the case that the value of a variable must be changed for use with DAST API. For example, an _environment_ scope might contain a variable named `api_version` with a value of `v2`, while your test needs a value of `v1`. Instead of modifying the exported file to change the value, the DAST API scope can be used. This works because the _DAST API_ scope takes precedence over all other scopes.

In this example, a _global_ scope, _environment_ scope, _collection_ scope, and _DAST API_ scope are configured. The first step is to export and create our various scopes.

- [Export the _global_ scope](https://learning.postman.com/docs/sending-requests/variables/#downloading-global-environments) as `global-scope.json`
- [Export the _environment_ scope](https://learning.postman.com/docs/getting-started/importing-and-exporting-data/#exporting-environments) as `environment-scope.json`
- Export the Postman Collection which includes the _collection_ scope as `postman-collection.json`

The DAST API scope is used by creating a file `dast-api-scope.json` using our [custom JSON file format](#dast-api-scope-custom-json-file-format). This JSON is an object with key-value pairs for properties. The keys are the variables' names, and the values are the variables'
values. For example:

```json
{
  "api_version": "v1"
}
```

The Postman Collection is provided using the `DAST_API_POSTMAN_COLLECTION` variable, while the other scopes are provided using the `DAST_API_POSTMAN_COLLECTION_VARIABLES`. DAST API can identify which scope the provided files match using data provided in each file.

```yaml
stages:
  - dast

include:
  - template: DAST-API.gitlab-ci.yml

variables:
  DAST_API_PROFILE: Quick
  DAST_API_POSTMAN_COLLECTION: postman-collection.json
  DAST_API_POSTMAN_COLLECTION_VARIABLES: global-scope.json,environment-scope.json,dast-api-scope.json
  DAST_API_TARGET_URL: http://test-deployment/
```

## Authentication

Authentication is handled by providing the authentication token as a header or cookie. You can
provide a script that performs an authentication flow or calculates the token.

### HTTP Basic Authentication

[HTTP basic authentication](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basic_access_authentication)
is an authentication method built into the HTTP protocol and used in conjunction with
[transport layer security (TLS)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transport_Layer_Security).

We recommended that you [create a CI/CD variable](../../../ci/variables/index.md#custom-cicd-variables)
for the password (for example, `TEST_API_PASSWORD`), and set it to be masked. You can create CI/CD
variables from the GitLab project's page at **Settings > CI/CD**, in the **Variables** section.
Because of the [limitations on masked variables](../../../ci/variables/index.md#mask-a-cicd-variable),
you should Base64-encode the password before adding it as a variable.

Finally, add two CI/CD variables to your `.gitlab-ci.yml` file:

- `DAST_API_HTTP_USERNAME`: The username for authentication.
- `DAST_API_HTTP_PASSWORD_BASE64`: The Base64-encoded password for authentication.

```yaml
stages:
  - dast

include:
  - template: DAST-API.gitlab-ci.yml

variables:
  DAST_API_PROFILE: Quick
  DAST_API_HAR: test-api-recording.har
  DAST_API_TARGET_URL: http://test-deployment/
  DAST_API_HTTP_USERNAME: testuser
  DAST_API_HTTP_PASSWORD_BASE64: $TEST_API_PASSWORD
```

#### Raw password

If you do not want to Base64-encode the password (or if you are using GitLab 15.3 or earlier) you can provide the raw password `DAST_API_HTTP_PASSWORD`, instead of using `DAST_API_HTTP_PASSWORD_BASE64`.

### Bearer tokens

Bearer tokens are used by several different authentication mechanisms, including OAuth2 and JSON Web
Tokens (JWT). Bearer tokens are transmitted using the `Authorization` HTTP header. To use Bearer
tokens with DAST API, you need one of the following:

- A token that doesn't expire.
- A way to generate a token that lasts the length of testing.
- A Python script that DAST API can call to generate the token.

#### Token doesn't expire

If the Bearer token doesn't expire, use the `DAST_API_OVERRIDES_ENV` variable to provide it. This
variable's content is a JSON snippet that provides headers and cookies to add to DAST API's
outgoing HTTP requests.

Follow these steps to provide the Bearer token with `DAST_API_OVERRIDES_ENV`:

1. [Create a CI/CD variable](../../../ci/variables/index.md#custom-cicd-variables),
   for example `TEST_API_BEARERAUTH`, with the value
   `{"headers":{"Authorization":"Bearer dXNlcm5hbWU6cGFzc3dvcmQ="}}` (substitute your token). You
   can create CI/CD variables from the GitLab projects page at **Settings > CI/CD**, in the
   **Variables** section.
   Due to the format of `TEST_API_BEARERAUTH` it's not possible to mask the variable.
   To mask the token's value, you can create a second variable with the token values, and define
   `TEST_API_BEARERAUTH` with the value `{"headers":{"Authorization":"Bearer $MASKED_VARIABLE"}}`.

1. In your `.gitlab-ci.yml` file, set `DAST_API_OVERRIDES_ENV` to the variable you just created:

   ```yaml
   stages:
     - dast

   include:
     - template: DAST-API.gitlab-ci.yml

   variables:
     DAST_API_PROFILE: Quick
     DAST_API_OPENAPI: test-api-specification.json
     DAST_API_TARGET_URL: http://test-deployment/
     DAST_API_OVERRIDES_ENV: $TEST_API_BEARERAUTH
   ```

1. To validate that authentication is working, run a DAST API test and review the job logs
   and the test API's application logs.

#### Token generated at test runtime

If the Bearer token must be generated and doesn't expire during testing, you can provide DAST API with a file that has the token. A prior stage and job, or part of the DAST API job, can
generate this file.

DAST API expects to receive a JSON file with the following structure:

```json
{
  "headers" : {
    "Authorization" : "Bearer dXNlcm5hbWU6cGFzc3dvcmQ="
  }
}
```

This file can be generated by a prior stage and provided to DAST API through the
`DAST_API_OVERRIDES_FILE` CI/CD variable.

Set `DAST_API_OVERRIDES_FILE` in your `.gitlab-ci.yml` file:

```yaml
stages:
  - dast

include:
  - template: DAST-API.gitlab-ci.yml

variables:
  DAST_API_PROFILE: Quick
  DAST_API_OPENAPI: test-api-specification.json
  DAST_API_TARGET_URL: http://test-deployment/
  DAST_API_OVERRIDES_FILE: dast-api-overrides.json
```

To validate that authentication is working, run a DAST API test and review the job logs and
the test API's application logs.

#### Token has short expiration

If the Bearer token must be generated and expires prior to the scan's completion, you can provide a
program or script for the DAST API scanner to execute on a provided interval. The provided script runs in
an Alpine Linux container that has Python 3 and Bash installed. If the Python script requires
additional packages, it must detect this and install the packages at runtime.

The script must create a JSON file containing the Bearer token in a specific format:

```json
{
  "headers" : {
    "Authorization" : "Bearer dXNlcm5hbWU6cGFzc3dvcmQ="
  }
}
```

You must provide three CI/CD variables, each set for correct operation:

- `DAST_API_OVERRIDES_FILE`: JSON file the provided command generates.
- `DAST_API_OVERRIDES_CMD`: Command that generates the JSON file.
- `DAST_API_OVERRIDES_INTERVAL`: Interval (in seconds) to run command.

For example:

```yaml
stages:
  - dast

include:
  - template: DAST-API.gitlab-ci.yml

variables:
  DAST_API_PROFILE: Quick
  DAST_API_OPENAPI: test-api-specification.json
  DAST_API_TARGET_URL: http://test-deployment/
  DAST_API_OVERRIDES_FILE: dast-api-overrides.json
  DAST_API_OVERRIDES_CMD: renew_token.py
  DAST_API_OVERRIDES_INTERVAL: 300
```

To validate that authentication is working, run an DAST API test and review the job logs and the test API's application logs. See the [overrides section](#overrides) for more information about override commands.

## Configuration files

To get you started quickly, GitLab provides the configuration file
[`gitlab-dast-api-config.yml`](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/security-products/analyzers/dast/-/blob/master/config/gitlab-dast-api-config.yml).
This file has several testing profiles that perform various numbers of tests. The run time of each
profile increases as the test numbers go up. To use a configuration file, add it to your
repository's root as `.gitlab/gitlab-dast-api-config.yml`.

### Profiles

The following profiles are pre-defined in the default configuration file. Profiles
can be added, removed, and modified by creating a custom configuration.

## Overrides

DAST API provides a method to add or override specific items in your request, for example:

- Headers
- Cookies
- Query string
- Form data
- JSON nodes
- XML nodes

You can use this to inject semantic version headers, authentication, and so on. The
[authentication section](#authentication) includes examples of using overrides for that purpose.

Overrides use a JSON document, where each type of override is represented by a JSON object:

```json
{
  "headers": {
    "header1": "value",
    "header2": "value"
  },
  "cookies": {
    "cookie1": "value",
    "cookie2": "value"
  },
  "query":      {
    "query-string1": "value",
    "query-string2": "value"
  },
  "body-form":  {
    "form-param1": "value",
    "form-param2": "value"
  },
  "body-json":  {
    "json-path1": "value",
    "json-path2": "value"
  },
  "body-xml" :  {
    "xpath1":    "value",
    "xpath2":    "value"
  }
}
```

Example of setting a single header:

```json
{
  "headers": {
    "Authorization": "Bearer dXNlcm5hbWU6cGFzc3dvcmQ="
  }
}
```

Example of setting both a header and cookie:

```json
{
  "headers": {
    "Authorization": "Bearer dXNlcm5hbWU6cGFzc3dvcmQ="
  },
  "cookies": {
    "flags": "677"
  }
}
```

Example usage for setting a `body-form` override:

```json
{
  "body-form":  {
    "username": "john.doe"
  }
}
```

The override engine uses `body-form` when the request body has only form-data content.

Example usage for setting a `body-json` override:

```json
{
  "body-json":  {
    "$.credentials.access-token": "iddqd!42.$"
  }
}
```

Note that each JSON property name in the object `body-json` is set to a [JSON Path](https://goessner.net/articles/JsonPath/)
expression. The JSON Path expression `$.credentials.access-token` identifies the node to be
overridden with the value `iddqd!42.$`. The override engine uses `body-json` when the request body
has only [JSON](https://www.json.org/json-en.html) content.

For example, if the body is set to the following JSON:

```json
{
    "credentials" : {
        "username" :"john.doe",
        "access-token" : "non-valid-password"
    }
}
```

It is changed to:

```json
{
    "credentials" : {
        "username" :"john.doe",
        "access-token" : "iddqd!42.$"
    }
}
```

Here's an example for setting a `body-xml` override. The first entry overrides an XML attribute and
the second entry overrides an XML element:

```json
{
  "body-xml" :  {
    "/credentials/@isEnabled": "true",
    "/credentials/access-token/text()" : "iddqd!42.$"
  }
}
```

Note that each JSON property name in the object `body-xml` is set to an
[XPath v2](https://www.w3.org/TR/xpath20/)
expression. The XPath expression `/credentials/@isEnabled` identifies the attribute node to override
with the value `true`. The XPath expression `/credentials/access-token/text()` identifies the
element node to override with the value `iddqd!42.$`. The override engine uses `body-xml` when the
request body has only [XML](https://www.w3.org/XML/)
content.

For example, if the body is set to the following XML:

```xml
<credentials isEnabled="false">
  <username>john.doe</username>
  <access-token>non-valid-password</access-token>
</credentials>
```

It is changed to:

```xml
<credentials isEnabled="true">
  <username>john.doe</username>
  <access-token>iddqd!42.$</access-token>
</credentials>
```

You can provide this JSON document as a file or environment variable. You may also provide a command
to generate the JSON document. The command can run at intervals to support values that expire.

### Using a file

To provide the overrides JSON as a file, the `DAST_API_OVERRIDES_FILE` CI/CD variable is set. The path is relative to the job current working directory.

Here's an example `.gitlab-ci.yml`:

```yaml
stages:
  - dast

include:
  - template: DAST-API.gitlab-ci.yml

variables:
  DAST_API_PROFILE: Quick
  DAST_API_OPENAPI: test-api-specification.json
  DAST_API_TARGET_URL: http://test-deployment/
  DAST_API_OVERRIDES_FILE: dast-api-overrides.json
```

### Using a CI/CD variable

To provide the overrides JSON as a CI/CD variable, use the `DAST_API_OVERRIDES_ENV` variable.
This allows you to place the JSON as variables that can be masked and protected.

In this example `.gitlab-ci.yml`, the `DAST_API_OVERRIDES_ENV` variable is set directly to the JSON:

```yaml
stages:
  - dast

include:
  - template: DAST-API.gitlab-ci.yml

variables:
  DAST_API_PROFILE: Quick
  DAST_API_OPENAPI: test-api-specification.json
  DAST_API_TARGET_URL: http://test-deployment/
  DAST_API_OVERRIDES_ENV: '{"headers":{"X-API-Version":"2"}}'
```

In this example `.gitlab-ci.yml`, the `SECRET_OVERRIDES` variable provides the JSON. This is a
[group or instance level CI/CD variable defined in the UI](../../../ci/variables/index.md#add-a-cicd-variable-to-an-instance):

```yaml
stages:
  - dast

include:
  - template: DAST-API.gitlab-ci.yml

variables:
  DAST_API_PROFILE: Quick
  DAST_API_OPENAPI: test-api-specification.json
  DAST_API_TARGET_URL: http://test-deployment/
  DAST_API_OVERRIDES_ENV: $SECRET_OVERRIDES
```

### Using a command

If the value must be generated or regenerated on expiration, you can provide a program or script for
the DAST API scanner to execute on a specified interval. The provided command runs in an Alpine Linux
container that has Python 3 and Bash installed.

You have to set the environment variable `DAST_API_OVERRIDES_CMD` to the program or script you would like
to execute. The provided command creates the overrides JSON file as defined previously.

You might want to install other scripting runtimes like NodeJS or Ruby, or maybe you need to install a dependency for
your overrides command. In this case, we recommend setting the `DAST_API_PRE_SCRIPT` to the file path of a script which
provides those prerequisites. The script provided by `DAST_API_PRE_SCRIPT` is executed once, before the analyzer starts.

See the [Alpine Linux package management](https://wiki.alpinelinux.org/wiki/Alpine_Linux_package_management)
page for information about installing Alpine Linux packages.

You must provide three CI/CD variables, each set for correct operation:

- `DAST_API_OVERRIDES_FILE`: File generated by the provided command.
- `DAST_API_OVERRIDES_CMD`: Overrides command in charge of generating the overrides JSON file periodically.
- `DAST_API_OVERRIDES_INTERVAL`: Interval in seconds to run command.

Optionally:

- `DAST_API_PRE_SCRIPT`: Script to install runtimes or dependencies before the scan starts.

WARNING:
To execute scripts in Alpine Linux you must first use the command [`chmod`](https://www.gnu.org/software/coreutils/manual/html_node/chmod-invocation.html) to set the [execution permission](https://www.gnu.org/software/coreutils/manual/html_node/Setting-Permissions.html). For example, to set the execution permission of `script.py` for everyone, use the command: `chmod a+x script.py`. If needed, you can version your `script.py` with the execution permission already set.

```yaml
stages:
  - dast

include:
  - template: DAST-API.gitlab-ci.yml

variables:
  DAST_API_PROFILE: Quick
  DAST_API_OPENAPI: test-api-specification.json
  DAST_API_TARGET_URL: http://test-deployment/
  DAST_API_OVERRIDES_FILE: dast-api-overrides.json
  DAST_API_OVERRIDES_CMD: renew_token.py
  DAST_API_OVERRIDES_INTERVAL: 300
```

### Debugging overrides

> [Introduced](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/334578) in GitLab 14.8.

By default the output of the overrides command is hidden. If the overrides command returns a non zero exit code, the command is displayed as part of your job output. Optionally, you can set the variable `DAST_API_OVERRIDES_CMD_VERBOSE` to any value in order to display overrides command output as it is generated. This is useful when testing your overrides script, but should be disabled afterwards as it slows down testing.

It is also possible to write messages from your script to a log file that is collected when the job completes or fails. The log file must be created in a specific location and following a naming convention.

Adding some basic logging to your overrides script is useful in case the script fails unexpectedly during normal running of the job. The log file is automatically included as an artifact of the job, allowing you to download it after the job has finished.

Following our example, we provided `renew_token.py` in the environment variable `DAST_API_OVERRIDES_CMD`. Please notice two things in the script:

- Log file is saved in the location indicated by the environmental variable `CI_PROJECT_DIR`.
- Log filename should match `gl-*.log`.

```python
#!/usr/bin/env python

# Example of an overrides command

# Override commands can update the overrides json file
# with new values to be used.  This is a great way to
# update an authentication token that will expire
# during testing.

import logging
import json
import os
import requests
import backoff

# [1] Store log file in directory indicated by env var CI_PROJECT_DIR
working_directory = os.environ.get( 'CI_PROJECT_DIR')
overrides_file_name = os.environ.get('DAST_API_OVERRIDES_FILE', 'dast-api-overrides.json')
overrides_file_path = os.path.join(working_directory, overrides_file_name)

# [2] File name should match the pattern: gl-*.log
log_file_path = os.path.join(working_directory, 'gl-user-overrides.log')

# Set up logger
logging.basicConfig(filename=log_file_path, level=logging.DEBUG)

# Use `backoff` decorator to retry in case of transient errors.
@backoff.on_exception(backoff.expo,
                      (requests.exceptions.Timeout,
                       requests.exceptions.ConnectionError),
                       max_time=30)
def get_auth_response():
    authorization_url = 'https://authorization.service/api/get_api_token'
    return requests.get(
        f'{authorization_url}',
        auth=(os.environ.get('AUTH_USER'), os.environ.get('AUTH_PWD'))
    )

# In our example, access token is retrieved from a given endpoint
try:

    # Performs a http request, response sample:
    # { "Token" : "b5638ae7-6e77-4585-b035-7d9de2e3f6b3" }
    response = get_auth_response()

    # Check that the request is successful. may raise `requests.exceptions.HTTPError`
    response.raise_for_status()

    # Gets JSON data
    response_body = response.json()

# If needed specific exceptions can be caught
# requests.ConnectionError                  : A network connection error problem occurred
# requests.HTTPError                        : HTTP request returned an unsuccessful status code. [Response.raise_for_status()]
# requests.ConnectTimeout                   : The request timed out while trying to connect to the remote server
# requests.ReadTimeout                      : The server did not send any data in the allotted amount of time.
# requests.TooManyRedirects                 : The request exceeds the configured number of maximum redirections
# requests.exceptions.RequestException      : All exceptions that related to Requests
except json.JSONDecodeError as json_decode_error:
    # logs errors related decoding JSON response
    logging.error(f'Error, failed while decoding JSON response. Error message: {json_decode_error}')
    raise
except requests.exceptions.RequestException as requests_error:
    # logs  exceptions  related to `Requests`
    logging.error(f'Error, failed while performing HTTP request. Error message: {requests_error}')
    raise
except Exception as e:
    # logs any other error
    logging.error(f'Error, unknown error while retrieving access token. Error message: {e}')
    raise

# computes object that holds overrides file content.
# It uses data fetched from request
overrides_data = {
    "headers": {
        "Authorization": f"Token {response_body['Token']}"
    }
}

# log entry informing about the file override computation
logging.info("Creating overrides file: %s" % overrides_file_path)

# attempts to overwrite the file
try:
    if os.path.exists(overrides_file_path):
        os.unlink(overrides_file_path)

    # overwrites the file with our updated dictionary
    with open(overrides_file_path, "wb+") as fd:
        fd.write(json.dumps(overrides_data).encode('utf-8'))
except Exception as e:
    # logs any other error
    logging.error(f'Error, unknown error when overwriting file {overrides_file_path}. Error message: {e}')
    raise

# logs informing override has finished successfully
logging.info("Override file has been updated")

# end
```

In the overrides command example, the Python script depends on the `backoff` library. To make sure the library is installed before executing the Python script, the `DAST_API_PRE_SCRIPT` is set to a script that will install the dependencies of your overrides command.
As for example, the following script `user-pre-scan-set-up.sh`

```shell
#!/bin/bash

# user-pre-scan-set-up.sh
# Ensures python dependencies are installed

echo "**** install python dependencies ****"

python3 -m ensurepip
pip3 install --no-cache --upgrade \
    pip \
    backoff

echo "**** python dependencies installed ****"

# end
```

You have to update your configuration to set the `DAST_API_PRE_SCRIPT` to our new `user-pre-scan-set-up.sh` script. For example:

```yaml
stages:
  - dast

include:
  - template: DAST-API.gitlab-ci.yml

variables:
  DAST_API_PROFILE: Quick
  DAST_API_OPENAPI: test-api-specification.json
  DAST_API_TARGET_URL: http://test-deployment/
  DAST_API_PRE_SCRIPT: user-pre-scan-set-up.sh
  DAST_API_OVERRIDES_FILE: dast-api-overrides.json
  DAST_API_OVERRIDES_CMD: renew_token.py
  DAST_API_OVERRIDES_INTERVAL: 300
```

In the previous sample, you could use the script `user-pre-scan-set-up.sh` to also install new runtimes or applications that later on you could use in our overrides command.

## Exclude Paths

> [Introduced](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/211892) in GitLab 14.0.

When testing an API it can be useful to exclude certain paths. For example, you might exclude testing of an authentication service or an older version of the API. To exclude paths, use the `DAST_API_EXCLUDE_PATHS` CI/CD variable . This variable is specified in your `.gitlab-ci.yml` file. To exclude multiple paths, separate entries using the `;` character. In the provided paths you can use a single character wildcard `?` and `*` for a multiple character wildcard.

To verify the paths are excluded, review the `Tested Operations` and `Excluded Operations` portion of the job output. You should not see any excluded paths listed under `Tested Operations`.

```plaintext
2021-05-27 21:51:08 [INF] API Security: --[ Tested Operations ]-------------------------
2021-05-27 21:51:08 [INF] API Security: 201 POST http://target:7777/api/users CREATED
2021-05-27 21:51:08 [INF] API Security: ------------------------------------------------
2021-05-27 21:51:08 [INF] API Security: --[ Excluded Operations ]-----------------------
2021-05-27 21:51:08 [INF] API Security: GET http://target:7777/api/messages
2021-05-27 21:51:08 [INF] API Security: POST http://target:7777/api/messages
2021-05-27 21:51:08 [INF] API Security: ------------------------------------------------
```

### Examples

This example excludes the `/auth` resource. This does not exclude child resources (`/auth/child`).

```yaml
variables:
  DAST_API_EXCLUDE_PATHS: /auth
```

To exclude `/auth`, and child resources (`/auth/child`), we use a wildcard.

```yaml
variables:
  DAST_API_EXCLUDE_PATHS: /auth*
```

To exclude multiple paths we use the `;` character. In this example we exclude `/auth*` and `/v1/*`.

```yaml
variables:
  DAST_API_EXCLUDE_PATHS: /auth*;/v1/*
```

To exclude one or more nested levels within a path we use `**`. In this example we are testing API endpoints. We are testing `/api/v1/` and `/api/v2/` of a data query requesting `mass`, `brightness` and `coordinates` data for `planet`, `moon`, `star`, and `satellite` objects. Example paths that could be scanned include, but are not limited to:

- `/api/v2/planet/coordinates`
- `/api/v1/star/mass`
- `/api/v2/satellite/brightness`

In this example we test the `brightness` endpoint only:

```yaml
variables:
  DAST_API_EXCLUDE_PATHS: /api/**/mass;/api/**/coordinates
```

### Exclude parameters

> [Introduced](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/292196) in GitLab 14.10.

While testing an API you may might want to exclude a parameter (query string, header, or body element) from testing. This may be needed because a parameter always causes a failure, slows down testing, or for other reasons. To exclude parameters, you can set one of the following variables: `DAST_API_EXCLUDE_PARAMETER_ENV` or `DAST_API_EXCLUDE_PARAMETER_FILE`.

The `DAST_API_EXCLUDE_PARAMETER_ENV` allows providing a JSON string containing excluded parameters. This is a good option if the JSON is short and will not often change. Another option is the variable `DAST_API_EXCLUDE_PARAMETER_FILE`. This variable is set to a file path that can be checked into the repository, created by another job as an artifact, or generated at runtime with a pre script using `DAST_API_PRE_SCRIPT`.

#### Exclude parameters using a JSON document

The JSON document contains a JSON object, this object uses specific properties to identify which parameter should be excluded.
You can provide the following properties to exclude specific parameters during the scanning process:

- `headers`: Use this property to exclude specific headers. The property's value is an array of header names to be excluded. Names are case-insensitive.
- `cookies`: Use this property's value to exclude specific cookies. The property's value is an array of cookie names to be excluded. Names are case-sensitive.
- `query`: Use this property to exclude specific fields from the query string. The property's value is an array of field names from the query string to be excluded. Names are case-sensitive.
- `body-form`: Use this property to exclude specific fields from a request that uses the media type `application/x-www-form-urlencoded`. The property's value is an array of the field names from the body to be excluded. Names are case-sensitive.
- `body-json`: Use this property to exclude specific JSON nodes from a request that uses the media type `application/json`. The property's value is an array, each entry of the array is a [JSON Path](https://goessner.net/articles/JsonPath/) expression.
- `body-xml`: Use this property to exclude specific XML nodes from a request that uses media type `application/xml`. The property's value is an array, each entry of the array is a [XPath v2](https://www.w3.org/TR/xpath20/) expression.

Thus, the following JSON document is an example of the expected structure to exclude parameters.

```json
{
  "headers": [
    "header1",
    "header2"
  ],
  "cookies": [
    "cookie1",
    "cookie2"
  ],
  "query": [
    "query-string1",
    "query-string2"
  ],
  "body-form": [
    "form-param1",
    "form-param2"
  ],
  "body-json": [
    "json-path-expression-1",
    "json-path-expression-2"
  ],
  "body-xml" : [
    "xpath-expression-1",
    "xpath-expression-2"
  ]
}
```

#### Examples

##### Excluding a single header

To exclude the header `Upgrade-Insecure-Requests`, set the `header` property's value to an array with the header name: `[ "Upgrade-Insecure-Requests" ]`. For instance, the JSON document looks like this:

```json
{
  "headers": [ "Upgrade-Insecure-Requests" ]
}
```

Header names are case-insensitive, so the header name `UPGRADE-INSECURE-REQUESTS` is equivalent to `Upgrade-Insecure-Requests`.

##### Excluding both a header and two cookies

To exclude the header `Authorization`, and the cookies `PHPSESSID` and `csrftoken`, set the `headers` property's value to an array with header name `[ "Authorization" ]` and the `cookies` property's value to an array with the cookies' names `[ "PHPSESSID", "csrftoken" ]`. For instance, the JSON document looks like this:

```json
{
  "headers": [ "Authorization" ],
  "cookies": [ "PHPSESSID", "csrftoken" ]
}
```

##### Excluding a `body-form` parameter

To exclude the `password` field in a request that uses `application/x-www-form-urlencoded`, set the `body-form` property's value to an array with the field name `[ "password" ]`. For instance, the JSON document looks like this:

```json
{
  "body-form":  [ "password" ]
}
```

The exclude parameters uses `body-form` when the request uses a content type `application/x-www-form-urlencoded`.

##### Excluding a specific JSON nodes using JSON Path

To exclude the `schema` property in the root object, set the `body-json` property's value to an array with the JSON Path expression `[ "$.schema" ]`.

The JSON Path expression uses special syntax to identify JSON nodes: `$` refers to the root of the JSON document, `.` refers to the current object (in our case the root object), and the text `schema` refers to a property name. Thus, the JSON path expression `$.schema` refers to a property `schema` in the root object.
For instance, the JSON document looks like this:

```json
{
  "body-json": [ "$.schema" ]
}
```

The exclude parameters uses `body-json` when the request uses a content type `application/json`. Each entry in `body-json` is expected to be a [JSON Path expression](https://goessner.net/articles/JsonPath/). In JSON Path characters like `$`, `*`, `.` among others have special meaning.

##### Excluding multiple JSON nodes using JSON Path

To exclude the property `password` on each entry of an array of `users` at the root level, set the `body-json` property's value to an array with the JSON Path expression `[ "$.users[*].paswword" ]`.

The JSON Path expression starts with `$` to refer to the root node and uses `.` to refer to the current node. Then, it uses `users` to refer to a property and the characters `[` and `]` to enclose the index in the array you want to use, instead of providing a number as an index you use `*` to specify any index. After the index reference, we find `.` which now refers to any given selected index in the array, preceded by a property name `password`.

For instance, the JSON document looks like this:

```json
{
  "body-json": [ "$.users[*].paswword" ]
}
```

The exclude parameters uses `body-json` when the request uses a content type `application/json`. Each entry in `body-json` is expected to be a [JSON Path expression](https://goessner.net/articles/JsonPath/). In JSON Path characters like `$`, `*`, `.` among others have special meaning.

##### Excluding a XML attribute

To exclude an attribute named `isEnabled` located in the root element `credentials`, set the `body-xml` property's value to an array with the XPath expression `[ "/credentials/@isEnabled" ]`.

The XPath expression `/credentials/@isEnabled`, starts with `/` to indicate the root of the XML document, then it is followed by the word `credentials` which indicates the name of the element to match. It uses a `/` to refer to a node of the previous XML element, and the character `@` to indicate that the name `isEnable` is an attribute.

For instance, the JSON document looks like this:

```json
{
  "body-xml": [
    "/credentials/@isEnabled"
  ]
}
```

The exclude parameters uses `body-xml` when the request uses a content type `application/xml`. Each entry in `body-xml` is expected to be a [XPath v2 expression](https://www.w3.org/TR/xpath20/). In XPath expressions characters like `@`, `/`, `:`, `[`, `]` among others have special meanings.

##### Excluding a XML text's element

To exclude the text of the `username` element contained in root node `credentials`, set the `body-xml` property's value to an array with the XPath expression `[/credentials/username/text()" ]`.

In the XPath expression `/credentials/username/text()`, the first character `/` refers to the root XML node, and then after it indicates an XML element's name `credentials`. Similarly, the character `/` refers to the current element, followed by a new XML element's name `username`. Last part has a `/` that refers to the current element, and uses a XPath function called `text()` which identifies the text of the current element.

For instance, the JSON document looks like this:

```json
{
  "body-xml": [
    "/credentials/username/text()"
  ]
}
```

The exclude parameters uses `body-xml` when the request uses a content type `application/xml`. Each entry in `body-xml` is expected to be a [XPath v2 expression](https://www.w3.org/TR/xpath20/). In XPath expressions characters like `@`, `/`, `:`, `[`, `]` among others have special meanings.

##### Excluding an XML element

To exclude the element `username` contained in root node `credentials`, set the `body-xml` property's value to an array with the XPath expression `[/credentials/username" ]`.

In the XPath expression `/credentials/username`, the first character `/` refers to the root XML node, and then after it indicates an XML element's name `credentials`. Similarly, the character `/` refers to the current element, followed by a new XML element's name `username`.

For instance, the JSON document looks like this:

```json
{
  "body-xml": [
    "/credentials/username"
  ]
}
```

The exclude parameters uses `body-xml` when the request uses a content type `application/xml`. Each entry in `body-xml` is expected to be a [XPath v2 expression](https://www.w3.org/TR/xpath20/). In XPath expressions characters like `@`, `/`, `:`, `[`, `]` among others have special meanings.

##### Excluding an XML node with namespaces

To exclude anXML element `login` which is defined in namespace `s`, and contained in `credentials` root node, set the `body-xml` property's value to an array with the XPath expression `[ "/credentials/s:login" ]`.

In the XPath expression `/credentials/s:login`, the first character `/` refers to the root XML node, and then after it indicates an XML element's name `credentials`. Similarly, the character `/` refers to the current element, followed by a new XML element's name `s:login`. Notice that name contains the character `:`, this character separates the namespace from the node name.

The namespace name should have been defined in the XML document which is part of the body request. You may check the namespace in the specification document HAR, OpenAPI, or Postman Collection file.

```json
{
  "body-xml": [
    "/credentials/s:login"
  ]
}
```

The exclude parameters uses `body-xml` when the request uses a content type `application/xml`. Each entry in `body-xml` is expected to be an [XPath v2 expression](https://www.w3.org/TR/xpath20/). In XPath, expressions characters like `@`, `/`, `:`, `[`, `]` among others have special meanings.

#### Using a JSON string

To provide the exclusion JSON document set the variable `DAST_API_EXCLUDE_PARAMETER_ENV` with the JSON string. In the following example, the `.gitlab-ci.yml`, the `DAST_API_EXCLUDE_PARAMETER_ENV` variable is set to a JSON string:

```yaml
stages:
  - dast

include:
  - template: DAST-API.gitlab-ci.yml

variables:
  DAST_API_PROFILE: Quick
  DAST_API_OPENAPI: test-api-specification.json
  DAST_API_TARGET_URL: http://test-deployment/
  DAST_API_EXCLUDE_PARAMETER_ENV: '{ "headers": [ "Upgrade-Insecure-Requests" ] }'
```

#### Using a file

To provide the exclusion JSON document set the variable `DAST_API_EXCLUDE_PARAMETER_FILE` with the JSON file path. The file path is relative to the job current working directory. In the following example `.gitlab-ci.yml` content, the `DAST_API_EXCLUDE_PARAMETER_FILE` variable is set to a JSON file path:

```yaml
stages:
  - dast

include:
  - template: DAST-API.gitlab-ci.yml

variables:
  DAST_API_PROFILE: Quick
  DAST_API_OPENAPI: test-api-specification.json
  DAST_API_TARGET_URL: http://test-deployment/
  DAST_API_EXCLUDE_PARAMETER_FILE: dast-api-exclude-parameters.json
```

The `dast-api-exclude-parameters.json` is a JSON document that follows the structure of [exclude parameters document](#exclude-parameters-using-a-json-document).

### Exclude URLs

> [Introduced](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/357195) in GitLab 14.10.

As an alternative to excluding by paths, you can filter by any other component in the URL by using the `DAST_API_EXCLUDE_URLS` CI/CD variable. This variable can be set in your `.gitlab-ci.yml` file. The variable can store multiple values, separated by commas (`,`). Each value is a regular expression. Because each entry is a regular expression, an entry like `.*` will exclude all URLs because it is a regular expression that matches everything.

In your job output you can check if any URLs matched any provided regular expression from `DAST_API_EXCLUDE_URLS`. Matching operations are listed in the **Excluded Operations** section. Operations listed in the **Excluded Operations** should not be listed in the **Tested Operations** section. For example the following portion of a job output:

```plaintext
2021-05-27 21:51:08 [INF] API Security: --[ Tested Operations ]-------------------------
2021-05-27 21:51:08 [INF] API Security: 201 POST http://target:7777/api/users CREATED
2021-05-27 21:51:08 [INF] API Security: ------------------------------------------------
2021-05-27 21:51:08 [INF] API Security: --[ Excluded Operations ]-----------------------
2021-05-27 21:51:08 [INF] API Security: GET http://target:7777/api/messages
2021-05-27 21:51:08 [INF] API Security: POST http://target:7777/api/messages
2021-05-27 21:51:08 [INF] API Security: ------------------------------------------------
```

NOTE:
Each value in `DAST_API_EXCLUDE_URLS` is a regular expression. Characters such as `.` , `*` and `$` among many others have special meanings in [regular expressions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regular_expression#Standards).

#### Examples

##### Excluding a URL and child resources

The following example excludes the URL `http://target/api/auth` and its child resources.

```yaml
stages:
  - dast

include:
  - template: DAST-API.gitlab-ci.yml

variables:
  DAST_API_TARGET_URL: http://target/
  DAST_API_OPENAPI: test-api-specification.json
  DAST_API_EXCLUDE_URLS: http://target/api/auth
```

##### Excluding two URLs and allow their child resources

To exclude the URLs `http://target/api/buy` and `http://target/api/sell` but allowing to scan their child resources, for instance: `http://target/api/buy/toy` or `http://target/api/sell/chair`. You could use the value `http://target/api/buy/$,http://target/api/sell/$`. This value is using two regular expressions, each of them separated by a `,` character. Hence, it contains `http://target/api/buy$` and `http://target/api/sell$`. In each regular expression, the trailing `$` character points out where the matching URL should end.

```yaml
stages:
  - dast

include:
  - template: DAST-API.gitlab-ci.yml

variables:
  DAST_API_TARGET_URL: http://target/
  DAST_API_OPENAPI: test-api-specification.json
  DAST_API_EXCLUDE_URLS: http://target/api/buy/$,http://target/api/sell/$
```

##### Excluding two URLs and their child resources

In order to exclude the URLs: `http://target/api/buy` and `http://target/api/sell`, and their child resources. To provide multiple URLs we use the `,` character as follows:

```yaml
stages:
  - dast

include:
  - template: DAST-API.gitlab-ci.yml

variables:
  DAST_API_TARGET_URL: http://target/
  DAST_API_OPENAPI: test-api-specification.json
  DAST_API_EXCLUDE_URLS: http://target/api/buy,http://target/api/sell
```

##### Excluding URL using regular expressions

In order to exclude exactly `https://target/api/v1/user/create` and `https://target/api/v2/user/create` or any other version (`v3`,`v4`, and more). We could use `https://target/api/v.*/user/create$`, in the previous regular expression `.` indicates any character and `*` indicates zero or more times, additionally `$` indicates that the URL should end there.

```yaml
stages:
  - dast

include:
  - template: DAST-API.gitlab-ci.yml

variables:
  DAST_API_TARGET_URL: http://target/
  DAST_API_OPENAPI: test-api-specification.json
  DAST_API_EXCLUDE_URLS: https://target/api/v.*/user/create$
```

## Running your first scan

When configured correctly, a CI/CD pipeline contains a `dast` stage and an `dast_api` job. The job only fails when an invalid configuration is provided. During normal operation, the job always succeeds even if vulnerabilities are identified during testing.

Vulnerabilities are displayed on the **Security** pipeline tab with the suite name. When testing against the repositories default branch, the DAST API vulnerabilities are also shown on the Security & Compliance's Vulnerability Report page.

To prevent an excessive number of reported vulnerabilities, the DAST API scanner limits the number of vulnerabilities it reports per operation.

## Viewing DAST API vulnerabilities

The DAST API analyzer produces a JSON report that is collected and used
[to populate the vulnerabilities into GitLab vulnerability screens](#view-details-of-a-dast-api-vulnerability).

See [handling false positives](#handling-false-positives) for information about configuration changes you can make to limit the number of false positives reported.

### View details of a DAST API vulnerability

Follow these steps to view details of a vulnerability:

1. You can view vulnerabilities in a project, or a merge request:

   - In a project, go to the project's **{shield}** **Security & Compliance > Vulnerability Report**
     page. This page shows all vulnerabilities from the default branch only.
   - In a merge request, go the merge request's **Security** section and select the **Expand**
     button. DAST API vulnerabilities are available in a section labeled
     **DAST detected N potential vulnerabilities**. Select the title to display the vulnerability
     details.

1. Select the vulnerabilities title to display the details. The table below describes these details.

   | Field               | Description                                                                             |
   |:--------------------|:----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
   | Description         | Description of the vulnerability including what was modified.                           |
   | Project             | Namespace and project in which the vulnerability was detected.                          |
   | Method              | HTTP method used to detect the vulnerability.                                           |
   | URL                 | URL at which the vulnerability was detected.                                            |
   | Request             | The HTTP request that caused the vulnerability.                                         |
   | Unmodified Response | Response from an unmodified request. This is what a normal working response looks like. |
   | Actual Response     | Response received from test request.                                                    |
   | Evidence            | How we determined a vulnerability occurred.                                             |

   | Scanner Type        | Scanner used to perform testing.                                                        |

### Security Dashboard

The Security Dashboard is a good place to get an overview of all the security vulnerabilities in your groups, projects and
pipelines. For more information, see the [Security Dashboard documentation](../security_dashboard/index.md).

### Interacting with the vulnerabilities

Once a vulnerability is found, you can interact with it. Read more on how to
[address the vulnerabilities](../vulnerabilities/index.md).

### Handling False Positives

False positives can be handled in several ways:

- Dismiss the vulnerability.
- Some checks have several methods of detecting when a vulnerability is identified, called _Assertions_.
  Assertions can also be turned off and configured. For example, the DAST API scanner by default uses HTTP
  status codes to help identify when something is a real issue. If an API returns a 500 error during
  testing, this creates a vulnerability. This isn't always desired, as some frameworks return 500 errors often.
- Turn off the Check producing the false positive. This prevents the check from generating any
  vulnerabilities. Example checks are the SQL Injection Check, and JSON Hijacking Check.

#### Turn off a Check

Checks perform testing of a specific type and can be turned on and off for specific configuration
profiles. The provided [configuration files](#configuration-files) define several profiles that you
can use. The profile definition in the configuration file lists all the checks that are active
during a scan. To turn off a specific check, remove it from the profile definition in the
configuration file. The profiles are defined in the `Profiles` section of the configuration file.

Example profile definition:

```yaml
Profiles:
  - Name: Quick
    DefaultProfile: Empty
    Routes:
      - Route: *Route0
        Checks:
          - Name: ApplicationInformationCheck
          - Name: CleartextAuthenticationCheck
          - Name: FrameworkDebugModeCheck
          - Name: HtmlInjectionCheck
          - Name: InsecureHttpMethodsCheck
          - Name: JsonHijackingCheck
          - Name: JsonInjectionCheck
          - Name: SensitiveInformationCheck
          - Name: SessionCookieCheck
          - Name: SqlInjectionCheck
          - Name: TokenCheck
          - Name: XmlInjectionCheck
```

To turn off the JSON Hijacking Check you can remove these lines:

```yaml
          - Name: JsonHijackingCheck
```

This results in the following YAML:

```yaml
- Name: Quick
  DefaultProfile: Empty
  Routes:
    - Route: *Route0
      Checks:
        - Name: ApplicationInformationCheck
        - Name: CleartextAuthenticationCheck
        - Name: FrameworkDebugModeCheck
        - Name: HtmlInjectionCheck
        - Name: InsecureHttpMethodsCheck
        - Name: JsonInjectionCheck
        - Name: SensitiveInformationCheck
        - Name: SessionCookieCheck
        - Name: SqlInjectionCheck
        - Name: TokenCheck
        - Name: XmlInjectionCheck
```

#### Turn off an Assertion for a Check

Assertions detect vulnerabilities in tests produced by checks. Many checks support multiple Assertions such as Log Analysis, Response Analysis, and Status Code. When a vulnerability is found, the Assertion used is provided. To identify which Assertions are on by default, see the Checks default configuration in the configuration file. The section is called `Checks`.

This example shows the SQL Injection Check:

```yaml
- Name: SqlInjectionCheck
  Configuration:
    UserInjections: []
  Assertions:
    - Name: LogAnalysisAssertion
    - Name: ResponseAnalysisAssertion
    - Name: StatusCodeAssertion
```

Here you can see three Assertions are on by default. A common source of false positives is
`StatusCodeAssertion`. To turn it off, modify its configuration in the `Profiles` section. This
example provides only the other two Assertions (`LogAnalysisAssertion`,
`ResponseAnalysisAssertion`). This prevents `SqlInjectionCheck` from using `StatusCodeAssertion`:

```yaml
Profiles:
  - Name: Quick
    DefaultProfile: Empty
    Routes:
      - Route: *Route0
        Checks:
          - Name: ApplicationInformationCheck
          - Name: CleartextAuthenticationCheck
          - Name: FrameworkDebugModeCheck
          - Name: HtmlInjectionCheck
          - Name: InsecureHttpMethodsCheck
          - Name: JsonHijackingCheck
          - Name: JsonInjectionCheck
          - Name: SensitiveInformationCheck
          - Name: SessionCookieCheck
          - Name: SqlInjectionCheck
            Assertions:
              - Name: LogAnalysisAssertion
              - Name: ResponseAnalysisAssertion
          - Name: TokenCheck
          - Name: XmlInjectionCheck
```

## Running DAST API in an offline environment

For self-managed GitLab instances in an environment with limited, restricted, or intermittent access to external resources through the internet, some adjustments are required for the DAST API testing job to successfully run.

Steps:

1. Host the Docker image in a local container registry.
1. Set the `SECURE_ANALYZERS_PREFIX` to the local container registry.

The Docker image for DAST API must be pulled (downloaded) from the public registry and then pushed (imported) into a local registry. The GitLab container registry can be used to locally host the Docker image. This process can be performed using a special template. See [loading Docker images onto your offline host](../offline_deployments/index.md#loading-docker-images-onto-your-offline-host) for instructions.

Once the Docker image is hosted locally, the `SECURE_ANALYZERS_PREFIX` variable is set with the location of the local registry. The variable must be set such that concatenating `/api-security:2` results in a valid image location.

NOTE:
DAST API and API Fuzzing both use the same underlying Docker image `api-security:2`.

For example, the below line sets a registry for the image `registry.gitlab.com/security-products/api-security:2`:

`SECURE_ANALYZERS_PREFIX: "registry.gitlab.com/security-products"`

NOTE:
Setting `SECURE_ANALYZERS_PREFIX` changes the Docker image registry location for all GitLab Secure templates.

For more information, see [Offline environments](../offline_deployments/index.md).

## Troubleshooting

### `Error waiting for API Security 'http://127.0.0.1:5000' to become available`

A bug exists in versions of the DAST API analyzer prior to v1.6.196 that can cause a background process to fail under certain conditions. The solution is to update to a newer version of the DAST API analyzer.

The version information can be found in the job details for the `dast_api` job.

If the issue is occurring with versions v1.6.196 or greater, please contact Support and provide the following information:

1. Reference this troubleshooting section and ask for the issue to be escalated to the Dynamic Analysis Team.
1. The full console output of the job.
1. The `gl-api-security-scanner.log` file available as a job artifact. In the right-hand panel of the job details page, select the **Browse** button.
1. The `dast_api` job definition from your `.gitlab-ci.yml` file.

### `Failed to start scanner session (version header not found)`

The DAST API engine outputs an error message when it cannot establish a connection with the scanner application component. The error message is shown in the job output window of the `dast_api` job. A common cause of this issue is changing the `DAST_API_API` variable from its default.

**Error message**

- In [GitLab 13.11 and later](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/323939), `Failed to start scanner session (version header not found).`
- In GitLab 13.10 and earlier, `API Security version header not found. Are you sure that you are connecting to the DAST API server?`.

**Solution**

- Remove the `DAST_API_API` variable from the `.gitlab-ci.yml` file. The value will be inherited from the DAST API CI/CD template. We recommend this method instead of manually setting a value.
- If removing the variable is not possible, check to see if this value has changed in the latest version of the [DAST API CI/CD template](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/blob/master/lib/gitlab/ci/templates/Security/DAST-API.gitlab-ci.yml). If so, update the value in the `.gitlab-ci.yml` file.

### `Application cannot determine the base URL for the target API`

The DAST API engine outputs an error message when it cannot determine the target API after inspecting the OpenAPI document. This error message is shown when the target API has not been set in the `.gitlab-ci.yml` file, it is not available in the `environment_url.txt` file, and it could not be computed using the OpenAPI document.

There is a order of precedence in which the DAST API engine tries to get the target API when checking the different sources. First, it will try to use the `DAST_API_TARGET_URL`. If the environment variable has not been set, then the DAST API engine will attempt to use the `environment_url.txt` file. If there is no file `environment_url.txt`, then the DAST API engine will use the OpenAPI document contents and the URL provided in `DAST_API_OPENAPI` (if a URL is provided) to try to compute the target API.

The best-suited solution will depend on whether or not your target API changes for each deployment. In static environments, the target API is the same for each deployment, in this case please refer to the [static environment solution](#static-environment-solution). If the target API changes for each deployment a [dynamic environment solution](#dynamic-environment-solutions) should be applied.

#### Static environment solution

This solution is for pipelines in which the target API URL doesn't change (is static).

**Add environmental variable**

For environments where the target API remains the same, we recommend you specify the target URL by using the `DAST_API_TARGET_URL` environment variable. In your `.gitlab-ci.yml`, add a variable `DAST_API_TARGET_URL`. The variable must be set to the base URL of API testing target. For example:

```yaml
stages:
  - dast

include:
  - template: DAST-API.gitlab-ci.yml

variables:
  DAST_API_TARGET_URL: http://test-deployment/
  DAST_API_OPENAPI: test-api-specification.json
```

#### Dynamic environment solutions

In a dynamic environment your target API changes for each different deployment. In this case, there is more than one possible solution, we recommend you use the `environment_url.txt` file when dealing with dynamic environments.

**Use environment_url.txt**

To support dynamic environments in which the target API URL changes during each pipeline, DAST API engine supports the use of an `environment_url.txt` file that contains the URL to use. This file is not checked into the repository, instead it's created during the pipeline by the job that deploys the test target and collected as an artifact that can be used by later jobs in the pipeline. The job that creates the `environment_url.txt` file must run before the DAST API engine job.

1. Modify the test target deployment job adding the base URL in an `environment_url.txt` file at the root of your project.
1. Modify the test target deployment job collecting the `environment_url.txt` as an artifact.

Example:

```yaml
deploy-test-target:
  script:
    # Perform deployment steps
    # Create environment_url.txt (example)
    - echo http://${CI_PROJECT_ID}-${CI_ENVIRONMENT_SLUG}.example.org > environment_url.txt

  artifacts:
    paths:
      - environment_url.txt
```

### Use OpenAPI with an invalid schema

There are cases where the document is autogenerated with an invalid schema or cannot be edited manually in a timely manner. In those scenarios, the DAST API is able to perform a relaxed validation by setting the variable `DAST_API_OPENAPI_RELAXED_VALIDATION`. We recommend providing a fully compliant OpenAPI document to prevent unexpected behaviors.

#### Edit a non-compliant OpenAPI file

To detect and correct elements that don't comply with the OpenAPI specifications, we recommend using an editor. An editor commonly provides document validation, and suggestions to create a schema-compliant OpenAPI document. Suggested editors include:

| Editor | OpenAPI 2.0 | OpenAPI 3.0.x | OpenAPI 3.1.x |
| -- | -- | -- | -- |
| [Swagger Editor](https://editor.swagger.io/) | **{check-circle}** YAML, JSON | **{check-circle}** YAML, JSON | **{dotted-circle}** YAML, JSON |
| [Stoplight Studio](https://stoplight.io/studio) | **{check-circle}** YAML, JSON | **{check-circle}** YAML, JSON | **{check-circle}** YAML, JSON |

If your OpenAPI document is generated manually, load your document in the editor and fix anything that is non-compliant. If your document is generated automatically, load it in your editor to identify the issues in the schema, then go to the application and perform the corrections based on the framework you are using.

#### Enable OpenAPI relaxed validation

Relaxed validation is meant for cases when the OpenAPI document cannot meet OpenAPI specifications, but it still has enough content to be consumed by different tools. A validation is performed but less strictly in regards to document schema.

DAST API can still try to consume an OpenAPI document that does not fully comply with OpenAPI specifications. To instruct DAST API to perform a relaxed validation, set the variable `DAST_API_OPENAPI_RELAXED_VALIDATION` to any value, for example:

```yaml
stages:
  - dast

include:
  - template: DAST-API.gitlab-ci.yml

variables:
  DAST_API_PROFILE: Quick
  DAST_API_TARGET_URL: http://test-deployment/
  DAST_API_OPENAPI: test-api-specification.json
  DAST_API_OPENAPI_RELAXED_VALIDATION: 'On'
```

### `No operation in the OpenAPI document is consuming any supported media type`

DAST API uses the specified media types in the OpenAPI document to generate requests. If no request can be created due to the lack of supported media types, then an error will be thrown.

**Error message**

- In [GitLab 14.10 and later](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/333304), `Error, no operation in the OpenApi document is consuming any supported media type. Check 'OpenAPI Specification' to check the supported media types.`

**Solution**

1. Review supported media types in the [OpenAPI Specification](#openapi-specification) section.
1. Edit your OpenAPI document, allowing at least a given operation to accept any of the supported media types. Alternatively, a supported media type could be set in the OpenAPI document level and get applied to all operations. This step may require changes in your application to ensure the supported media type is accepted by the application.

## Glossary

- Assert: Assertions are detection modules used by checks to trigger a vulnerability. Many assertions have
  configurations. A check can use multiple Assertions. For example, Log Analysis, Response Analysis,
  and Status Code are common Assertions used together by checks. Checks with multiple Assertions
  allow them to be turned on and off.
- Check: Performs a specific type of test, or performed a check for a type of vulnerability. For
  example, the SQL Injection Check performs DAST testing for SQL Injection vulnerabilities. The DAST API scanner is comprised of several checks. Checks can be turned on and off in a profile.
- Profile: A configuration file has one or more testing profiles, or sub-configurations. You may
  have a profile for feature branches and another with extra testing for a main branch.

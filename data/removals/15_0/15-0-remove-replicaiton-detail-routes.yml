    In GitLab 13.0, we introduced new project and design replication details routes in the Geo Admin UI. These routes are `/admin/geo/replication/projects` and `/admin/geo/replication/designs`. We kept the legacy routes and redirected them to the new routes. These legacy routes `/admin/geo/projects` and `/admin/geo/designs` have been removed in GitLab 15.0. Please update any bookmarks or scripts that may use the legacy routes.

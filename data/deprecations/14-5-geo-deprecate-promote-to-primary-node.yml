    In GitLab 14.5, we introduced the command `gitlab-ctl promote` to promote any Geo secondary node to a primary during a failover. This command replaces `gitlab-ctl promote-to-primary-node` which was only usable for single-node Geo sites. `gitlab-ctl promote-to-primary-node` will continue to function as-is and be available until GitLab 15.0. We recommend that Geo customers begin testing the new `gitlab-ctl promote` command in their staging environments and incorporating the new command in their failover procedures.
